# LiveRamp Integration Tips

Publishers already using LiveRamp Authenticated Traffic Solution (ATS) can leverage their integration to generate a UID2 token to be passed in the bid request.

If you want to generate UID2 tokens using LiveRamp ATS, reach out to your LiveRamp representative and also make sure you've addressed the following integration points: 

- [Enable RideAlong](#enable-ridealong)
- [Implement the Correct Hashing Methodology](#implement-the-correct-hashing-methodology)
- [Make Sure the Envelope Refresh Setting Is Set to 1800 Seconds](#make-sure-the-envelope-refresh-setting-is-set-to-1800-seconds)
- [Make Sure the Expire Setting Is Set Correctly](#make-sure-the-expire-setting-is-set-correctly)

## Enable RideAlong

In your LiveRamp configuration, you must make sure that RideAlong is enabled. RideAlong is a LiveRamp feature that enables other identity solutions, such as UID2, to embed their identifiers in ATS envelopes. If RideAlong is not enabled, UID2 tokens are not correctly sent.

To complete this step, contact your LiveRamp representative.

## Implement the Correct Hashing Methodology

The hashing methodology used by the UID2 service is very specific. If you use a different hashing algorithm, or miss any of the steps, your UID2s will not be correctly generated.

For information about the required hashing methodology, see [Normalization and Encoding](../getting-started/gs-normalization-encoding.md).

## Make Sure the Envelope Refresh Setting Is Set to 1800 Seconds

When enabling `ATS.js` within `Prebid.js`, make sure that `storage.refreshInSeconds` is set to **1800 seconds** (30 minutes).

## Make Sure the Expire Setting Is Set Correctly

When enabling `ATS.js` within `Prebid.js`, check the value specified for the `expire` setting.

The LiveRamp ATS envelope is typically set up to expire after 15 or 30 days; UID2 tokens have a much shorter lifetime. This is determined by the `expire` setting in the LiveRamp configuration.

Typically, either 15 days or 30 days is an acceptable value.

[**GWH_DR: Playbook says "we are still evaluating the impact of expire, but typically either 15 or 30 days is set". I'm not sure if this is talking about the default or the recommendation. What do we recommend here?**]
