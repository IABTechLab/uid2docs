I created the diagram using draw.io which is also available as a macro in confluence. So if you can edit the doc, then you can edit the diagram as well. Let me see if I can export as an svg.

The diagram is created in the context of that Confluence page. From there, I can export as PNG and also SVG (had to embed images for SVG).
