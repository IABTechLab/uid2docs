## Overview

The UID2 Operator service can be run in Google Cloud Platform within a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) called a [Confidential VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm), which is a trusted computing enclave.

The enclave must use a [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs) boot disk, which can be customized through the provided [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/) configuration.

The `cloud-init` config does the following:
1. Disables remote SSH access to the VM, allowing only UID2 traffic to go in and out.
2. Creates a `systemd` service, which does the following:
   1. Pulls the certified UID2 Operator Docker image from the UID2 project's Docker registry on GitHub (ghcr.io), using `docker pull`.
   2. Starts the container.

When the UID2 Operator's Docker container starts up, it does the following:
1. Obtains an [instance identity token](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/verifying-instance-identity) - a unique JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes details of the VM instance it is running on, as well as Google's RS256 signature.
2. Sends the instance identity token, plus the UID2 `api_token` specified in the `cloud-init` config, to the UID2 Core Service as an Attestation Request.

When the UID2 Core Service receives the Attestation Request, it verifies the `api_token` and instance identity token.
As part of the Attestation Process for the operator, the UID2 Core Service also sends GCP API calls to retrieve VM instance metadata, such as the boot disk, `cloud-init` config, and audit logs.

When the attestation is successful, the UID2 Core Service provides seed information such as salts and keys, to bootstrap the UID2 Operator Service.

## Build

You can pull the official Docker image to run UID2 Operator on GCP Confidential VM enclave from the GitHub Container Registry location using the following Docker command:
 - docker pull ghcr.io/iabtechlab/uid2-operator

You can build a non-certified UID2 Operator container image from the source code  using the following command:

```
scripts/gcp/build.sh ghcr.io/iabtechlab/uid2-operator:v1.0.0-snapshot
```

## Attestation Requirements

The UID2 Operator Service can be run on any GCP account and project. However, to support Attestation, the project must grant several
permissions to the service account that the UID2 Core Service uses to issue the GCP API calls during Attestation.

| Permission | How the UID2 Core Service Uses It |
| :--- | :--- |
| `compute.instances.get` | Retrieves VM instance information, such as `cloud-init` config. |
| `compute.disks.get` | Gets details of the VM boot disk. |
| `logging.logEntries.list` | Lists audit logs for the VM instance. |

An alternative approach is to grant pre-defined GCP roles to UID2 Core's service account. These roles include the required permissions, as shown in the following table.

| Role | Permissions Included |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Compute Viewer` | `compute.instances.get`<br/>`compute.disks.get` |
| `Logs Viewer` | `logging.logEntries.list` |

## Integration Deployment

You can deploy a new UID2 Operator Service in a GCP VM Enclave into the integration environment by preparing a certified
cloud-init.yaml file for the integration environment, and then create a new Confidential VM that uses the `cloud-init` config.

This section describes the deployment process.

### Cloud-init.yaml File
During the registration process, you will be provided with a certified cloud-init-`<timestamp>`.yaml file. This file cannot be modified in any way (other than to add the Client API Key) as the sha256sum of the file is used as part of the attestation process. The contents of the file is discussed below, but the file is never created manually during the deployment process - it is always created by the UID team during the process of setting up a new private operator.

Note that the cloud-init.yaml file is specific to an environment, so you will have one for the integration environment, and one for the production environment.

### cloud-init Example

This is the `cloud-init` template to use for deploying UID2 Operator Enclave into the integration environment. This section discusses the contents of the file, but you must use the one provided during the registration process.

The file content should be provided as custom metadata under the key `user-data` when creating the VM instance. This `user-data`
metadata will be read and interpreted by the Container-Optimized OS (COS) VM disk during
booting.

As shown in the example below, it first disables remote SSH access, and then tells
COS VM to pull the certified UID2 Operator Docker image from UID2 project's official
Container Registry, using `docker pull`, and run the UID2 Operator container as a `systemd` service.

In the file you are provided with, the `UID2_ENCLAVE_IMAGE_ID` and `GHCR_RO_ACCESS_TOKEN` values are already set. There is no need to edit them manually.
You will be provided with the UID2_ENCLAVE_API_TOKEN separately, and will need to update this value in the file. 

```

    }
```

### Create VM Instance

To create a new VM instance, follow these steps with the files that you were given during the registration process.

1. Copy the cloud-init-`<timestamp>`.yaml file into a temporary location.
2. Run the [gcloud script](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/scripting-with-gcloud-a-beginners-guide-to-automating-gcp-tasks) file 
from the same folder.
  This creates a new GCP Confidential VM that uses the correct VM image as well as the `cloud-init` file. 

An example of the `gcloud` script file is:

```
$ gcloud compute instances \
  create uid2-operator-gcp-01 \
  --confidential-compute \
  --maintenance-policy Terminate \
  --image https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/cos-cloud/global/images/cos-stable-101-17162-40-56 \
  --metadata-from-file user-data=./cloud-init-1674598899.yaml \
  --tags http-server
```

You can change the name of the VM (uid2-operator-gcp-01 in the example above), but no other parameters can be changed, or attestation will fail. 

## Production Deployment

We can deploy a new UID2 Operator in GCP VM Enclave into the production environment by following the same process as for Integration.
You will need a new instance of the cloud-init-`<timestamp>`.yaml file. This file uses the production URLs for the UID2 Core Service. 
You will also be given a new `gcloud` script file. There are only two differences between the script file for the integration environment and the file for the production environment:
- The name of the cloud-init-`<timestamp>`.yaml file used.
- The `machine-type` setting. It is recommended that for the production environment you specify the machine type in the `gcloud` script. Currently, it is recommended that you run the UID2 operator on a machine type of `n2d-standard-16`.

The following is an example of the script.

```
$ gcloud compute instances \
  create uid2-operator-gcp-01 \
  --machine-type n2d-standard-16 \
  --confidential-compute \
  --maintenance-policy Terminate \
  --image https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/cos-cloud/global/images/cos-stable-101-17162-40-56 \
  --metadata-from-file user-data=./cloud-init-1674598899.yaml \
  --tags http-server
```

>NOTE: Compared to the `gcloud` command used in the prior section, an additional option, `--machine-type n2d-standard-16`, is added. This option ensures that the production deployment of the UID2 Operator Service runs on
the recommended machine type that matches the production configuration.

## Upgrading

For each operator version update, private operators receive an email notification with an upgrade window, after which the old version is deactivated and no longer supported. 
To upgrade to the latest version, deploy the new `cloud-init` configuration provided in the email in the same way as you deployed the original operator.
