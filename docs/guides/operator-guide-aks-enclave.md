# UID2 Private Operator for AKS Integration Guide

The UID2 Operator is the API server in the UID2 ecosystem. For details, see [The UID2 Operator](../ref-info/ref-operators-public-private.md).

This guide provides information for setting up the UID2 Operator Service as a <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-private-operator">Private Operator</Link> in an Azure Kubernetes Service (<Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-aks">AKS</Link>) cluster, running on [virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-virtual-nodes) (ACI). Virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances enable us to take advantage of confidential containers, which run in a hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that provides intrinsic capabilities such as data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity. 

When the Docker container for the UID2 Operator confidential Azure Container instance starts up, it completes the attestation process that allows the UID2 Core Service to verify the authenticity of the Operator Service and of the enclave environment that the Operator Service is running in.

When the attestation is successful, the UID2 Core Service provides seed information such as salts and keys to bootstrap the UID2 Operator in the secure UID2 Operator confidential Azure Container Instance.

:::caution
UID2 Private Operator for AKS is not supported in these areas: Europe, China.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the UID2 Private Operator for AKS, complete these prerequisite steps:

- [Set Up the UID2 Operator Account](#set-up-the-uid2-operator-account)
- [Install the Azure CLI](#install-the-azure-cli)
- [Get the Required Azure Permissions](#get-the-required-azure-permissions)
- [Install the kubectl CLI](#install-the-kubectl-cli)
- [Install the Helm CLI](#install-the-helm-cli)

### Set Up the UID2 Operator Account

Ask your UID2 contact to register your organization as a UID2 Operator. If you're not sure who to ask, see [Contact Info](../getting-started/gs-account-setup.md#contact-info).

When the registration process is complete, you'll receive an operator key, exclusive to you, that identifies you with the UID2 service as a Private Operator. During configuration, use this as the value for `OPERATOR_KEY`. This value is both your unique identifier and a password; store it securely and do not share it.

:::note
You'll receive a separate operator key for each deployment environment.
:::

### Install the Azure CLI

Install the Azure command-line interface. For details, see [How to install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in the Azure documentation.

### Get the Required Azure Permissions

You'll need to have subscription owner permission so that you can create a resource group.

When that's done, you only need contributor permission on the resource group level for that resource.

For details, see [Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#azure-roles) in the Azure documentation.

When all prerequisite steps are complete, you're ready to deploy the UID2 Private Operator. See [Deployment](#deployment).

### Install the kubectl CLI

Install the Kubernetes `kubectl` command-line interface. For details, see [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

### Install the Helm CLI

Install the `helm` command-line interface. For details, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.

## Deployment Environments

The following environments are available. As a best practice, we recommend that you test and verify your implementation in the integration environment before deploying in the production environment.

:::note
You'll receive separate `{OPERATOR_KEY}` values for each environment. Be sure to use the correct key for the environment you're using. The deployment artifacts and the process flow are the same for both environments.
:::

| Environment | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Integration (`integ`) | For testing only. Debug mode is available in the integration environment. |
| Production (`prod`) | For managing production traffic. |

- [Setting up a virtual node Environment](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualNodesOnAzureContainerInstances?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-a-virtual-node-environment)

### Set Up AKS Cluster

To set up the AKS cluster, run the following command, using your own values as needed:

```
az aks get-credentials --name ${AKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}

az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance

git clone git@github.com:microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances.git

helm install virtualnode virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances/Helm/virtualnode
 
# Wait for ~1 minute for virtualnode-0 to appear.
kubectl get nodes
```

### Complete Key Vault and Managed Identity Setup

The next step is to set up a [key vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) and save the operator key in it. When you've created the key vault, you can create a [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and grant it permission to access the key vault.

Later, when the AKS cluster launches, it uses this identity. For details, see [Running pods with an Azure Managed Identity](https://github.com/microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances/blob/main/Docs/PodCustomizations.md#running-pods-with-an-azure-managed-identity) in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

Follow these steps:

```
az identity create --name "${MANAGED_IDENTITY}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --location "${LOCATION}"

az keyvault create --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --location "${LOCATION}" --enable-purge-protection --enable-rbac-authorization

export KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID="$(az keyvault show --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" --query id --output tsv)"

az keyvault secret set --vault-name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" --name "${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME}" --value "<some value>"

export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID="$(az identity show --name "${MANAGED_IDENTITY}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query principalId --output tsv)"

az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID}" --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --scope "${KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID}" --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal
```

### Complete the UID2 Private Operator Setup

To complete the Private Operator setup, follow these steps:

- [Update Placeholder Values](#update-placeholder-values)
- [Deploy Operator](#deploy-operator)

#### Update Placeholder Values

After completing the previous steps, follow these steps to update placeholder values:

1. Get the managed identity ID by running the following:

   ```
   MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity show --name "${MANAGED_IDENTITY}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query id --output tsv)
   ```

2. In the `operator.yaml` file, update `microsoft.containerinstance.virtualnode.identity` with the managed identity ID that was returned:

   - For Linux, run:

   ```
   sed -i "s#IDENTITY_PLACEHOLDER#$MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID#g" "operator.yaml"
   ```

   - For MacOS, run:

   ```
   sed -i '' "s#IDENTITY_PLACEHOLDER#$MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID#g" "operator.yaml"
   ```

3. Update the Vault Key and Secret names with the environment variables:

   - For Linux, run:


   ```
   sed -i "s#VAULT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER#$KEYVAULT_NAME#g" "operator.yaml"
   sed -i "s#OPERATOR_KEY_SECRET_NAME_PLACEHOLDER#$KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME#g" "operator.yaml"
   sed -i "s#DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_PLACEHOLDER#$DEPLOYMENT_ENV#g" "operator.yaml"
   ```

   - For MacOS, run:

   ```
   sed -i '' "s#VAULT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER#$KEYVAULT_NAME#g" "operator.yaml"
   sed -i '' "s#OPERATOR_KEY_SECRET_NAME_PLACEHOLDER#$KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME#g" "operator.yaml"
   sed -i '' "s#DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_PLACEHOLDER#$DEPLOYMENT_ENV#g" "operator.yaml"
   ```


#### Deploy Operator

Follow these steps to deploy the Private Operator:

1. Retrieve the Kubernetes configuration credentials for the AKS cluster you just created:

   ```
   az aks get-credentials --name ${AKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
   ```

2. When you've retrieved the Kubernetes configuration credentials, deploy the Private Operator by running the following:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f operator.yaml
   ```

## Running the Health Check

Call the health check endpoint to test the health of your implementation.

Running the health check is the same for the integration and production environments, except for the endpoints.

Follow these steps:

1. Get the public IP address for the service:

   ```
   IP=$(az network public-ip list --resource-group ${AKS_NODE_RESOURCE_GROUP} --query "[?starts_with(name, 'kubernetes')].ipAddress" --output tsv)
   ```

2. To test operator status, in your browser, go to the health check endpoint: `http://${IP}/ops/healthcheck`.

   An HTTP 200 with a response body of `OK` indicates healthy status.

import AttestFailure from '../snippets/_private-operator-attest-failure.mdx';

<AttestFailure />

## Upgrading

When a new version of UID2 Private Operator for AKS is released, participants hosting their own Private Operator receive an email notification of the update, with a new release link or instructions to get the installation file. There is a window of time for upgrade, after which the older version is deactivated and is no longer supported.

To upgrade, complete the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions in [Download ZIP File and Extract Files](#download-zip-file-and-extract-files) to download the deployment file for the new version and then unzip it.

2. Follow the instructions in [Complete the UID2 Private Operator Setup](#complete-the-uid2-private-operator-setup), using the new files, to deploy your AKS implementation with the new versions.

3. Check the health of the new AKS deployment and make sure the status is healthy.

4. Double-check that the old AKS pods are shut down properly:

   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
