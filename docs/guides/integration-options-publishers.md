CONVERSATION WITH KIMBERLY:

CSTG would be one route. Basically, what we want here is a pro and con list of why you would do CSTG versus not.
I can tell you what the pros are right now.
For client-side token generate, the pros are going to be: If you’re integrating client-side, we have a Prebid integration that handles the entire UID2 integration from a pub level.
And then… the con of that would then be:
•	You have to update to the latest Prebid version if you’re using Prebid to generate UID2s, 
•	and you need to keep an updated list of top level domains.
Kimberly: So then, for server-side the pros are… but can we also say you need to update the latest Prebid version and then just say in parentheses, if you're using Prebid to generate UID2s.
Kimberly: And then say, you can use the JavaScript SDK.
Kimberly: So server side pros are, you manage latency. I don't know if latency is the right word. Please get this approved by Andrei. And then what are the cons? No need for updating the top level domain.
Kimberly: and then, cons are, it's server side… what? That might not be a con. I feel like we need to –
More, considerations.
It's server side. Manage latency. And no need to update to any versions. Well… you do not need to update to the latest Prebid.
Kimberly: I don't know if we really need a table of it. But maybe like considerations of each route. And then we could say, like fully… You know what I mean. Cons is a little bit not so great.
Gen: Yeah. We don't want to present anything negatively. But… how can I say.. you know, have you seen Sunny's draft table? I feel like this ties into Sunny's table. Somehow or other, I think we need to present the potential paths and the considerations which would determine which path the publisher would choose. It could be even, if you don't want to upgrade to the latest Prebid you choose this, if you’re not using Prebid you choose this, or this, or whatever. There's different ways of doing it, I suppose.
Kimberly: That's it for right now.
Gen: So I just want, I just want to say, like, I feel like rather than a CSTG page, it's gonna be a publisher options.
Kimberly: Publisher Options page, yes.
