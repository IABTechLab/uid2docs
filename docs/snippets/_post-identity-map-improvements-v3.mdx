Version 3 of the `POST /identity/map` endpoint provides the following improvements over v2:

- **Support for multiple identity types**: You can process both email addresses and phone numbers in a single request.
- **Simpler refresh management**: You can just re-map any raw UID2 when it reaches the refresh timestamp, rather than monitoring salt buckets, which is a separate API call.
- **Availability of previous raw UID2**: You can see the previous UID2 for 90 days after rotation.
- **Improved performance**: The new API version uses significantly less bandwidth for the same amount of personal data.
