It's a good security practice to rotate the keys on a regular cadence.

[**GWH__SW question. In this doc (AWS) we mention: KMSKey, SSMKeyAlias, "the operator key", SSH key, the key store, OPERATOR_KEY, EC2 key pair. I'd like to be clear about naming and I'm frankly not sure... is it the operator key? Just need to be a bit clearer than "rotate the keys"**]
