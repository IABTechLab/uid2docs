If you're a publisher and want to keep your first-party data within your corporate network, you might choose to deploy a <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-private-operator">Private Operator</Link>. In this scenario, you choose to host a private instance exclusively for your own use.

For additional information, review these resources:

- [The UID2 Operator](../ref-info/ref-operators-public-private.md)
- [UID2 Private Operator Integration Overview](../guides/integration-options-private-operator.md)

:::note
The UID2 Private Operator solutions do not support client-side generation of the UID2 token. If you want a client-side implementation, you must use a Public Operator solution.
