The UID2 SDK can generate logs, which could help in debugging any issues during UID2 integration work. To enable logging, do the following:

<Tabs groupId="language-selection">
<TabItem value='android' label='Android'>

```js
// During UID2Manager initialization:
UID2Manager.init(
  context = this,
  isLoggingEnabled = true
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ios' label='iOS'>

```swift
UID2Settings.shared.isLoggingEnabled = true
// On iOS, you must set UID2Settings before you first access UID2Manager.shared. Changes made to settings after first access are not read.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
