If you intend to generate UID2 tokens to send to Google GMA/IMA SDKs, assuming you have followed the instructions in the [Client-Side Integration Guide for Mobile](integration-mobile-client-side.md) or the [Client-Server Integration Guide for Mobile](integration-mobile-client-server.md), you must also add the UID2 GMA/IMA plugins into your mobile app. For instructions, refer to the applicable plug-in guide:

- [UID2 GMA Plugin for Android Integration Guide](mobile-plugin-gma-android.md)
- [UID2 GMA Plugin for iOS Integration Guide](mobile-plugin-gma-ios.md)
- [UID2 IMA Plugin for Android Integration Guide](mobile-plugin-ima-android.md)
- [UID2 IMA Plugin for iOS Integration Guide](mobile-plugin-ima-ios.md)

:::note
You do not need to explicitly run the `getAdvertisingToken()` method call to retrieve the advertising tokens and pass them into Google GMA/IMA SDK manually. The UID2 GMA/IMA plugins manage this for you.
:::

All you need to do is make sure that `getAdvertisingToken()` returns a non-null string object:

<Tabs groupId="language-selection">
<TabItem value='android' label='Android'>

```js
UID2Manager.getInstance().getAdvertisingToken()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ios' label='iOS'>

```js
UID2Manager.shared.getAdvertisingToken()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the token exists, the Google GMA/IMA plug-ins can retrieve it via the UID2 GMA/IMA plugins.
