By default, the UID2 SDKs and Prebid.js implementation make API calls to a UID2 production environment server in the USA. Depending on where your users are based, you might consider choosing a server closer to your users to reduce latency.

For example, a publisher in Singapore can set the base URL to `https://sg.prod.uidapi.com`. This is still the UID2 production environment, but the servers are in Singapore.

You can also set the base URL to `https://global.prod.uidapi.com`. This URL directs readers to a region geographically close to them, which is ideal if your audience is geographically distributed.
