## Private Operator Attestation Failure
If the Private Operator's attempt to attest with the UID2 Core service, the Private Operator fails. This results in one of the following:
- HTTP 401 response. If your operator key receives a 401 response from the UID2 Core service, the Private Operator terminates itself immediately.
- Any other non-200 response code. If your Private Operator attest request receives any response code other than a 200 or a 401, it continues to function for 12 hours. If the issue is not resolved in this time frame, the Private Operator terminates itself.

Private Operator hosts must have infrastructure in place to handle alerting and restarting operators in the case of an error.
