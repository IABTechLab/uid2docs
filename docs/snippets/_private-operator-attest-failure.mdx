When a Private Operator fails to attest with the Core service, one of the following actions happens:
- HTTP 401 response. The Private Operator terminates itself immediately.
  - Likely Causes: API key revoked or incorrect.
- Any other non-200 response code. The Private Operator continues to function for 12 hours. If the issue is not resolved in this time frame, it terminates itself.
  - Likely Causes: Core service issues, network issues.

Private Operator hosts must have infrastructure in place to handle alerting and restarting operators in the case of an error.
