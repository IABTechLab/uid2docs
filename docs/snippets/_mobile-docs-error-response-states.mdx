In certain conditions, the mobile SDK might return one of the following error response states:

- [Expired](#response-state-of-expired)
- [RefreshExpired](#response-state-of-refreshexpired)
- [Invalid](#response-state-of-expired)
- [NoIdentity](#response-state-of-expired)

:::note
The response states are the same for both Android and iOS.

### Response State of Expired

A response state of `Expired` means that the UID2 token has expired but the refresh token has not expired, therefore the UID2 token can be refreshed.

**Automatic refresh**: If you have automatic refreshing enabled on the SDK (`automaticRefreshEnabled` property), which is the default setting, the SDK refreshes the token for you. However, there are some scenarios where you might observe this state.

For example, if the app is launched and the SDK is immediately queried, you might see a response state of `Expired` while, in the background, the SDK is in the process of refreshing the token and will quickly update with the new identity.

  In this scenario, no action is needed. As soon as the SDK is initialized, it will refresh the token.

**Manual refresh**: If you've disabled automatic refreshing of the token, and get a response state of `Expired`, you can manually request the refresh by calling the `refreshIdentity()` method.

### Response State of RefreshExpired

A response state of `RefreshExpired` means that the UID2 token and the refresh token have both expired, therefore the UID2 token cannot be refreshed.

An example of how this could occur is if a user does not run your app for a long time, and the SDK therefore doesn't get an opportunity to refresh the UID2 token before the refresh token expires.

In this scenario, you'd need to regenerate the identity.

### Response State of Invalid

A response state of `Invalid` means that the identity, whether loaded off disk or requested via the API, did not include all the necessary tokens. This should never happen, but might occur in unexpected circumstances.

If the SDK detects this error, it clears any previous identity since it's considered unusable.

In this scenario, you'd need to regenerate the identity. Ideally, also report the issue to your UID2 contact.

### Response State of NoIdentity

A response state of `NoIdentity` means that the SDK has been initialized, but doesn't yet have a current identity.

This happens the first time the SDK is used on a device, before any identity has been generated. In this scenario, you'd need to generate the identity.
