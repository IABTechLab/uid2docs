| E12 | Data Download Failure | Look for log messages containing `E12: Data Download Failure` or `Failed to load` errors from `RotatingStoreVerticle`. These messages include HTTP status codes (for example, `HTTP response code 403`) or exception types (for example, `exception: IOException`). | Check the HTTP status code or exception in the error message and resolve accordingly:<br/>**404 errors**: Verify that the operator key is valid for the environment.<br/>**403 errors**: Verify that the operator key and credentials are correct.<br/>**Timeout errors**: Verify network connectivity, check that firewall/security group settings allow outbound HTTPS (port 443), and ensure that the UID2 service endpoints are accessible.<br/>**500/503 errors**: This code indicates a temporary UID2 service issue. Retry, and if the error persists contact UID2 support. |
