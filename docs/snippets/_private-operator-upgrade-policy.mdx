To maintain security and operational integrity, outdated operator versions will be disabled after 12 months, which may cause affected deployments to shut down or fail to start. Upgrading ensures the use of the latest security and feature enhancements. We recommend upgrading proactively to avoid disruptions.

:::note
For critical security or operational issues, or where contract terms apply, we reserve the right to enforce tighter upgrade timelines for private operators.
