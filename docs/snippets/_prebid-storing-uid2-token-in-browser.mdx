By default, the UID2 module stores data using local storage. To use a cookie instead, set `params.storage` to `cookie`, as shown in the following example.

For details, see [Unified ID 2.0 Configuration](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/userid-submodules/unified2.html#unified-id-20-configuration) in the Prebid documentation.

```js
pbjs.setConfig({ 
  userSync: { 
    userIds: [{ 
      name: 'uid2', 
      params: { 
        // default value is 'localStorage' 
        storage: 'cookie'   
      } 
    }] 
  } 
}); 
```
The cookie size can be significant, which could be a problem. However, if local storage is not an option, this is one possible approach.
