# Implementing Tokenized Sharing

UID2 tokenized sharing means sharing encrypted raw UID2s with authorized sharing participants. Setting up tokenized sharing requires some steps by each participant:

Setting up UID2 sharing requires some steps by each participant:

- The **sender**, who encrypts raw UID2s into UID2 sharing tokens and sends them to an authorized sharing participant.
- The **receiver**, an authorized sharing participant who receives the UID2 sharing tokens and decrypts them.

>NOTE: If you are a publisher who is sharing UID2 tokens in the bid stream, see [Tokenized Sharing for Publishers in the Bid Stream](sharing-tokenized.md#tokenized-sharing-for-publishers-in-the-bid-stream).

## Sharing Steps: Summary

(**GWH_KT does this section, and the rest of this file, apply to both tokenized sharing and sharing raw UID2? Not modified as yet. Account setup applies to all, but not sure about the rest. And, do we want a parallel file for sharing raw UID2s? I think.**)

At a very high level, the following are the steps to set up and configure sharing:

1. All users must set up an account and configure sharing options. See [Steps to Implement Sharing: UID2 Portal Account Setup](#steps-to-implement-sharing-uid2-portal-account-setup).

2. To implement sharing in your code, choose from the following, depending on the integration option you're using:

   - [Steps to Implement Sharing With an SDK](#steps-to-implement-sharing-with-an-sdk)
   - [Steps to Implement Sharing Using Snowflake](#steps-to-implement-sharing-using-snowflake)

## Steps to Implement Sharing: UID2 Portal Account Setup

In the UID2 Portal, the sender and the receiver must set up an account, and the sender must configure sharing permissions.

The sender only needs to set up sharing permission once for each receiver or participant type. However, if you want to add new sharing permissions or change existing ones, you'll need to go back to adjust your settings.

For details, see [UID2 Portal: Overview](../portal/portal-overview.md) and follow the links for each task.

## Steps to Implement Sharing with an SDK

The following steps are for all sharing participants who are using an SDK&#8212;senders and receivers.

1. Decide which SDK to use, from the following options, and review the examples in the applicable sharing documentation to see what the sharing code might look like.

   | SDK/Integration Tool | Link to Sharing Section |
   | :--- | :--- | 
   | C# / .NET | [UID2 SDK for C# / .NET: Usage for UID2 Sharers](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-csharp-dotnet.md#usage-for-uid2-sharers) |
   | C++ | [UID2 SDK for C++: Usage for UID2 Sharers](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-cplusplus.md#usage-for-uid2-sharers) |
   | Java | [UID2 SDK for Java: Usage for UID2 Sharers](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-java.md#usage-for-uid2-sharers) |
   | Python | [UID2 SDK for Python: Usage for UID2 Sharers](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-python.md#usage-for-uid2-sharers) |

2. Integrate the SDK into your code to implement each step, depending on whether your role is sender or receiver. To see code examples for the language you're using, follow the link in the table provided in Step 1.
   1. Both senders and receivers: define the UID2 client.
   
   2. Both senders and receivers: define the schedule for refreshing encryption keys.
   
      Recommended refresh interval is hourly. For an example, see [Encryption/Decryption Key Refresh Cadence for Sharing (SDK Only)](#encryptiondecryption-key-refresh-cadence-for-sharing-sdk-only).

   3. Senders, set up encryption.

   4. Receivers, set up decryption.

## Steps to Implement Sharing Using Snowflake

The following steps are for Snowflake users who want to take part in UID2 sharing, either as senders or receivers.

1. Review the examples in the Snowflake Integration Guide, [Usage for UID2 Sharers](../guides/snowflake_integration.md#usage-for-uid2-sharers) section, to see what the sharing code might look like.

2. Integrate the SDK into your code, according to whether your role is sender or receiver. Use the code examples in the documentation referenced in the Snowflake Integration Guide, [UID2 Sharing Example](../guides/snowflake_integration.md#uid2-sharing-example):

   - Senders, set up encryption.

   - Receivers, set up decryption.

## Encryption/Decryption Key Refresh Cadence for Sharing (SDK Only)

If you're using an SDK, defining the schedule for refreshing the sharing keys is part of step 2.

For long/continuously running processes, call the `uid2client.refresh()` function once per hour. This allows the SDK to fetch the latest keys for decryption. When a new sharing permission is enabled, the additional set of encryption keys needed to decrypt the data sent by the new sharing sender is returned the next time the sharing receiver calls the `uid2client.refresh()` function. This process is handled by the SDK.

>NOTE: If you're using Snowflake, you don't need to do this step. The Snowflake UID2 integration takes care of refreshing the keys.

### Decryption Key Refresh Example

This example illustrates how the `uid2client.refresh()` function enables a new sharing permission. In this example, Advertiser ABC wants to send data to Data Provider XYZ.

1. 12:00 pm:

   The sharing permission is not yet enabled.

   Data Provider XYZ calls `uid2client.refresh()`. The decryption key for Advertiser ABC is not returned, so Data Provider XYZ cannot decrypt the UID2 tokens.

2. 12:30 pm:

   Advertiser ABC logs in to the UID2 Portal and creates a sharing permission with Data Provider XYZ.

3. 1:00 pm:

   Data Provider XYZ, on an hourly cadence, again calls `uid2client.refresh()`. Because there is a new sharing permission, the key for Advertiser ABC is returned in the response.

   Data Provider XYZ can now decrypt any UID2 token received from Advertiser ABC into a raw UID2.
