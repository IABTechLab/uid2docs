# Raw UID2 Sharing

If you want to share raw UID2s with another authorized sharing participant, you must adhere to the responsibilities of authentication, authorization, accounting, and secure transport, as specified in the [Security Requirements for UID2 Sharing](sharing-overview.md#security-requirements-for-uid2-sharing).

Make sure that all points are rigorously followed, so that the raw UID2s are kept secure at all times, whether in transit or in storage.
