# Sharing UID2s: Use Cases

There are many ways to implement sharing&#8212;many different examples of senders, receivers, and transfer methods.

When you use this feature, the secure sharing workflow allows you to share with trusted partners. For example, here are a few sample scenarios where a sender wants to share UID2s with a receiver: 

- A publisher (sender) sends a UID2 bid stream token via the bid stream to a DSP (receiver).
- A measurement partner (sender) sends a UID2 sharing token to an advertiser (receiver) via Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
- A DSP (sender) sends a UID2 sharing token to an advertiser (receiver) via reporting.

These scenarios, and others, are represented in the following diagram.

> NOTE: Any sender can transfer a UID2 sharing token to any receiver using one of the transfer methods. Only a handful of transfer methods have been defined here: there are many others.
