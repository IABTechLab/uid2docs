# Sharing UID2 Information: Use Cases

Some examples of scenarios where sharing UID2 information with other participants is beneficial.

<!-- It includes the following:

- [xxx](#xxx)
  - [xxx](#xxx)
  - [xxx](#xxx)
- [xxx](#xxx)
  - [xxx](#xxx)
  - [xxx](#xxx)
- [xxx](#xxx)
- [xxx](#xxx) -->

There are many ways to implement sharing. Here are a few examples:

- An advertiser (sender) sends a UID2 token to a DSP (receiver) for segment creation via an API.
- A measurement partner (sender) sends a UID2 token to an advertiser (receiver) via Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
- A publisher (sender) sends a UID2 token via a pixel to an advertiser (receiver).

BELOW PASDTE FROM KIMBERLY NOT YET REVIEWED -------------------------------------------------------------

The following denotes a handful of example scenarios of when a sender transfers a UID2 token to a receiver. There are many different examples of senders, receivers, and transfer methods.   
  
GEN QUESTION: SHOULD WE BE USING THE SAME AS WE HAVE IN THE OVERVIEW OR SHOULD I COME UP WITH DIFFERENT?
An advertiser (sender) sends a UID2 token to a DSP (receiver) for segment creation via an API.
A measurement partner (sender) sends a UID2 token to an advertiser (receiver) via an Amazon S3 data transfer.
A publisher (sender) sends a UID2 token to a data provider (receiver) via a pixel.
A DSP (sender) sends a UID2 token to an advertiser (receiver) via reporting.
