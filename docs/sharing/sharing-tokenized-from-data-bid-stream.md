# Tokenized Sharing in the Bid Stream

UID2 data shared to the bid stream must be in the form of UID2 tokens generated by encrypting [directly identifying information (DII)](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-dii) (an email address or phone number) directly into a UID2 token.

Publishers can encrypt the DII into a UID2 token, using one of the [implementation options](#tokenized-sharing-in-the-bid-stream-implementation-options), and then send the UID2 token into the bid stream.

:::caution
Data in the bid stream can be viewed in web traffic, so it is never acceptable to share raw UID2s in the bid stream. If you're sharing in the bid stream, tokenized sharing is required.

Additional information for publishers is on the following pages:
- [UID2 Overview for Publishers](../overviews/overview-publishers.md)
- [UID2 Portal: Overview](../portal/portal-overview.md)

### Audience

Tokenized sharing in the bid stream is applicable to the following audiences:

- **Sender**: Publisher. Account Setup in the UID2 Portal is optional.
- **Receiver**: DSP (**GWH_KL others?**). See [Information for Tokenized Sharing Receivers](#information-for-tokenized-sharing-receivers).

### Tokenized Sharing in the Bid Stream: Implementation Options

The following approaches are available for encrypting the DII directly into a UID2 token for sending in the bid stream:

| Integration Option | Token Generated Client-Side or Server-Side? | Integration Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Prebid.js | Client-Side | [UID2 Client-Side Integration Guide for Prebid.js](../guides/integration-prebid-client-side.md) |
| Prebid.js | Server-Side | [UID2 Server-Side Integration Guide for Prebid.js](../guides/integration-prebid-server-side.md) |
| JavaScript SDK | Client-Side | [Client-Side Integration Guide for JavaScript](../guides/publisher-client-side.md) |
| JavaScript SDK | Server-Side | [Server-Side Integration Guide for JavaScript](../guides/integration-javascript-server-side.md) |
| Java SDK | Server-Side | [UID2 SDK for Java Reference Guide](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-java.md) |
| Python SDK | Server-Side | [UID2 SDK for Python Reference Guide](../sdks/uid2-sdk-ref-python.md) |
| UID2 API (token generate and refresh) | Server-Side | [UID2 Tokens](../endpoints/summary-endpoints.md#uid2-tokens) | 

These options support generating UID2 tokens from email addresses or phone numbers and also refreshing the tokens regularly. Other SDKs do not support token generate and token refresh at this time.

### Optional: Account Setup in the UID2 Portal

If your only sharing activity is generating UID2 tokens from DII and sending them in the bid stream, you do not need to set up an account in the UID2 Portal and create sharing relationships. By default, publishers automatically share with all DSPs who are integrated with UID2.

However, you might choose to do this so that you can control who you share with. For example, you might want to share with a limited audience, one or more sharing partners, for security or other reasons.

For account setup information, see [Account Setup in the UID2 Portal](sharing-tokenized-overview.md#account-setup-in-the-uid2-portal).

For details, see [UID2 Portal: Overview](../portal/portal-overview.md) and follow the links for each task.

### Workflow: Tokenized Sharing in the Bid Stream

The workflow for generating UID2 tokens from DII, via the API or the specified server-side SDKs, consists of the following steps (each step links to the corresponding section):

1. Publisher: Integrate with UID2 using one of the integration options listed in [Tokenized Sharing in the Bid Stream: Implementation Options](#tokenized-sharing-in-the-bid-stream-implementation-options).

   >NOTE: The DSP must integrate with UID2 using one of the server-side SDKs. See [Tokenized Sharing Steps: Summary](../sharing/sharing-tokenized-overview.md#tokenized-sharing-steps-summary) (step 2).

1. (Optional) Publisher: Set up sharing permissions in the UID2 Portal to restrict who can decrypt your UID2 tokens:

   1. Publisher: Define which DSPs are allowed to decrypt your UID2 tokens. 
   1. Publisher and DSP: Create a UID2 Portal account.
   1. Publisher: Log in to the UID2 Portal and navigate to the sharing permissions page.
   1. Publisher: Select one or more DSPs that you want to share with. If needed, use the search feature to find specific DSPs.
   1. Publisher: Save the sharing selection.

1. The publisher completes the following steps to create and send the UID2 tokens:

   1. Generates a UID2 token from an email or phone number.
   1. Puts the UID2 token into the bid stream.

1. The DSP completes the following steps:

   1. Receives the UID2 tokens.
   1. Decrypts the UID2 tokens into raw UID2s and uses them.

The following diagram illustrates the UID2 sharing workflow for publishers.

### Token Example for Publishers in the Bid Stream

Publishers convert the input email address or phone number directly to a UID2 token for use in the bid stream, using one operation, as shown in the following example.

## Information for Sharing Receivers

To be able to decrypt a UID2 token into a raw UID2, you must be an authorized sharing receiver and have the sender's decryption keys. In most cases you also need a sharing relationship with the sender.

For details, see [Sharing Overview: Information for Tokenized Sharing Receivers](sharing-tokenized-overview.md#information-for-tokenized-sharing-receivers).

:::note
By default, for publishers sending UID2 tokens to the bid stream, the publisher's decryption keys are shared with all authorized DSPs. However, if the publisher sending the UID2 token has set up specific sharing relationships, you'll only receive that publisher's decryption keys if the publisher has created a sharing relationship with you.
