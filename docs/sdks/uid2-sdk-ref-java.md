## Overview

The functions outlined here define the information that you'll need to configure or can retrieve from the library. The parameters and property names defined below are pseudocode. Actual parameters and property names vary by language but will be similar to the information outlined here.

## Functionality

This SDK simplifies integration with UID2 for any publishers, DSPs, and UID2 sharers who are using Java for their server-side coding. The following table shows the functions it supports.

| Encrypt Raw UID2 to UID2 Token | Decrypt UID2 Token | Generate UID2 Token from DII | Refresh UID2 Token |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |

## Version

The SDK requires Java version 1.8 or later.

## GitHub Repository/Binary

This SDK is in the following open-source GitHub repository:

- [UID2 SDK for Java](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-java/blob/master/README.md)

The binary is published on the Maven repository:

- [https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.uid2/uid2-client](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.uid2/uid2-client)

## Initialization

The initialization function configures the parameters necessary for the SDK to authenticate with the UID2 service. It also allows you to configure retry intervals in the event of errors.

| Parameter | Description | Recommended Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `endpoint` | The endpoint for the UID2 service. | N/A |
| `authKey` | The authentication token that belongs to the client. For access to UID2, see [Contact Info](../getting-started/gs-account-setup.md#contact-info). | N/A |

## Interface 

The interface allows you to decrypt UID2 advertising tokens and return the corresponding raw UID2. 

:::note
When you use an SDK, you do not need to store or manage decryption keys.
:::

If you're a DSP, for bidding, call the interface to decrypt a UID2 advertising token and return the UID2. For details on the bidding logic for handling user opt-outs, see [DSP Integration Guide](../guides/dsp-guide.md).

The following is the decrypt method in Java:

```java
import com.uid2.client.IUID2Client
 
IUID2Client client = UID2ClientFactory.create(TEST_ENDPOINT, TEST_API_KEY, TEST_SECRET_KEY);
client.refresh(); //Note that refresh() should be called once after create(), and then once per hour
DecryptionResponse result = client.decrypt(TEST_TOKEN);
```

### Response Content

Available information returned through the SDK is outlined in the following table.

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GetStatus()` | The decryption result status. For a list of possible values and definitions, see [Response Statuses](#response-statuses). |
| `GetUid()` | The raw UID2 for the corresponding UID2 advertising token. |
| `GetEstablished()` | The timestamp indicating when a user first established the UID2 with the publisher. |

### Response Statuses

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Success` | The UID2 advertising token was decrypted successfully and a raw UID2 was returned. |
| `NotAuthorizedForKey` | The requester does not have authorization to decrypt this UID2 advertising token.|
| `NotInitialized` | The client library is waiting to be initialized. |
| `InvalidPayload` | The incoming UID2 advertising token is not a valid payload. |
| `ExpiredToken` | The incoming UID2 advertising token has expired. |
| `KeysNotSynced` | The client has failed to synchronize keys from the UID2 service. |
| `VersionNotSupported` |  The client library does not support the version of the encrypted token. |

## Usage for Publishers

As a publisher, there are two ways to use the UID2 SDK for Java: 
1. [**Basic Usage**](#basic-usage) is for publishers who want to use this SDK's HTTP implementation (synchronous [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)).
2. [**Advanced Usage**](#advanced-usage) is for publishers who prefer to use their own HTTP library. 

For an example application that demonstrates both Basic and Advanced usage, see [Java UID2 Integration Example](https://github.com/UnifiedID2/uid2-examples/tree/main/publisher/uid2-java-test-site#readme).

### Basic Usage

If you're using the SDK's HTTP implementation, follow these steps.

1. Create an instance of `PublisherUid2Client` as an instance variable:

   ```java
   private final PublisherUid2Client publisherUid2Client = new PublisherUid2Client(UID2_BASE_URL, UID2_API_KEY, UID2_SECRET_KEY);
   ```

2. Call a function that takes the user's email address or phone number as input and generates a `TokenGenerateResponse` object. The following example uses an email address:
   ```java
   TokenGenerateResponse tokenGenerateResponse = publisherUid2Client.generateTokenResponse(TokenGenerateInput.fromEmail(emailAddress).doNotGenerateTokensForOptedOut());
   ```

   :::important
   - Be sure to call the POST&nbsp;/token/generate endpoint only when you have obtained legal basis to convert the user’s [directly identifying information (DII)](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-dii) to UID2 tokens for targeted advertising.

   - Always apply `doNotGenerateTokensForOptedOut()`. This applies a parameter similar to setting `optout_check=1` in the call to the POST&nbsp;/token/generate endpoint (see [Unencrypted JSON Body Parameters](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md#unencrypted-json-body-parameters)).
   :::

#### Standard Integration

If you're using standard integration (client and server) (see [JavaScript Standard Integration Guide](../guides/integration-javascript-standard.md)), follow this step:

* Send this identity as a JSON string back to the client (to use in the [identity field](../sdks/client-side-identity.md#initopts-object-void)), using the following:

   ```java
   tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentityJsonString()
   ```

   :::note
   If the user has opted out, this method returns `null`, so be sure to handle that case.
   :::

#### Server-Only Integration

If you're using server-only integration (see [Publisher Integration Guide, Server-Only](../guides/custom-publisher-integration.md)), follow these steps:

1. Store this identity as a JSON string in the user's session, using the `tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentityJsonString()` function.

   If the user has opted out, this method returns `null`, so be sure to handle that case.

2. To retrieve the user's UID2 token, use the following:

   ```java
   IdentityTokens identity = tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentity();
   if (identity != null) { String advertisingToken = identity.getAdvertisingToken(); }
   ```
3. When the user accesses another page, or on a timer, determine whether a refresh is needed:
   1. Retrieve the identity JSON string from the user's session, and then call the following function that takes the identity information as input and generates an `IdentityTokens` object:

      ```java
      IdentityTokens identity = IdentityTokens.fromJsonString(identityJsonString);
      ```
   2. Determine if the identity can be refreshed (that is, the refresh token hasn't expired):

      ```java
      if (identity == null || !identity.isRefreshable()) { we must no longer use this identity (for example, remove this identity from the user's session) }
      ```
   3. Determine if a refresh is needed:

      ```java
      if (identity.isDueForRefresh()) {..}
      ```
4. If needed, refresh the token and associated values:
 
   ```java
   TokenRefreshResponse tokenRefreshResponse = publisherUid2Client.refreshToken(identity);
   ```
 
5. Store `tokenRefreshResponse.getIdentityJsonString()` in the user's session.

   If the user has opted out, this method returns `null`, indicating that the user's identity should be removed from the session. To confirm optout, you can use the `tokenRefreshResponse.isOptout()` function.

### Advanced Usage

1. Create an instance of `PublisherUid2Helper` as an instance variable:

    ```java
    private final PublisherUid2Helper publisherUid2Helper = new PublisherUid2Helper(UID2_SECRET_KEY);
    ```
2. Call a function that takes the user's email address or phone number as input and creates a secure request data envelope. See [Encrypting requests](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md#encrypting-requests). The following example uses an email address:

    ```java
    EnvelopeV2 envelope = publisherUid2Helper.createEnvelopeForTokenGenerateRequest(TokenGenerateInput.fromEmail(emailAddress).doNotGenerateTokensForOptedOut());
    ```
3. Using an HTTP client library of your choice, post this envelope to the [POST&nbsp;token/generate](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md) endpoint, including headers and body:
   1. Headers: Depending on your HTTP library, this might look something like the following:  
    
      `.putHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + UID2_API_KEY)`  
      `.putHeader("X-UID2-Client-Version", PublisherUid2Helper.getVersionHeader())`
   2. Body: `envelope.getEnvelope()`
   :::important
   - Be sure to call the POST&nbsp;/token/generate endpoint only when you have obtained legal basis to convert the user’s [directly identifying information (DII)](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-dii) to UID2 tokens for targeted advertising.

   - Always apply `doNotGenerateTokensForOptedOut()`. This applies a parameter similar to setting `optout_check=1` in the call to the POST&nbsp;/token/generate endpoint (see [Unencrypted JSON Body Parameters](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md#unencrypted-json-body-parameters)).
   :::

4. If the HTTP response status code is _not_ 200, see [Response Status Codes](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md#response-status-codes) to determine next steps. Otherwise, convert the UID2 identity response content into a `TokenGenerateResponse` object:

   ```java
   TokenGenerateResponse tokenGenerateResponse = publisherUid2Helper.createTokenGenerateResponse({response body}, envelope);
   ```

#### Standard Integration

If you're using standard integration (client and server) (see [JavaScript Standard Integration Guide](../guides/integration-javascript-standard.md)), follow this step:

* Send this identity as a JSON string back to the client (to use in the [identity field](../sdks/client-side-identity.md#initopts-object-void)) using the following:

    ```java
    tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentityJsonString()
    ```

    :::caution
    This method returns null if the user has opted out, so be sure to handle that case.
    :::

#### Server-Only Integration

If you're using server-only integration (see [Publisher Integration Guide, Server-Only](../guides/custom-publisher-integration.md)):

1. Store this identity as a JSON string in the user's session, using: `tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentityJsonString()`.

   This method returns null if the user has opted out, so be sure to handle that case.
2. To retrieve the user's UID2 token, use:

   ```java
   IdentityTokens identity = tokenGenerateResponse.getIdentity();
   if (identity != null) { String advertisingToken = identity.getAdvertisingToken(); }
   ```

3. When the user accesses another page, or on a timer, determine whether a refresh is needed:
   1. Retrieve the identity JSON string from the user's session, and then call the following function that generates an `IdentityTokens` object:
   
       ```java
       IdentityTokens identity = IdentityTokens.fromJsonString(identityJsonString);
       ```
   2. Determine whether the identity can be refreshed (that is, the refresh token hasn't expired): 
    
      ```java
      if (identity == null || !identity.isRefreshable()) { we must no longer use this identity (for example, remove this identity from the user's session) }
      ```
   3. Determine whether a refresh is needed:
   
      ```java
      if (identity.isDueForRefresh()) {..}
      ```
4. If a refresh is needed, call the [POST token/refresh](../endpoints/post-token-refresh.md) endpoint, with the following:
   1. Headers: Depending on your HTTP library, this might look something like the following:
    
      `.putHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + UID2_API_KEY)`  
      `.putHeader("X-UID2-Client-Version", PublisherUid2Helper.getVersionHeader())`. 
   2. Body: `identity.getRefreshToken()`
5. If the refresh HTTP response status code is 200:

   ```java
   TokenRefreshResponse tokenRefreshResponse = PublisherUid2Helper.createTokenRefreshResponse({response body}, identity);
   ```
6. Store `tokenRefreshResponse.getIdentityJsonString()` in the user's session.

   If the user has opted out, this method returns null, indicating that the user's identity should be removed from the session. To confirm optout, you can use the `tokenRefreshResponse.isOptout()` function.

## Usage for UID2 Sharers

A UID2 sharer is any participant that wants to share UID2s with another participant. Raw UID2s must be encrypted into UID2 tokens before sending them to another participant. For an example of usage, see [com.uid2.client.test.IntegrationExamples](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-java/blob/master/src/test/java/com/uid2/client/test/IntegrationExamples.java) (`runSharingExample` method).

>IMPORTANT: The UID2 token generated during this process is for sharing only&#8212;you cannot use it in the bid stream. There is a different workflow for generating tokens for the bid stream: see [Sharing in the Bid Stream](../sharing/sharing-bid-stream.md).

The following instructions provide an example of how you can implement sharing using the UID2 SDK for Java, either as a sender or a receiver.

1. Create a `IUID2Client` reference:

   ```java
   IUID2Client client = UID2ClientFactory.create(UID2_BASE_URL, UID2_API_KEY, UID2_SECRET_KEY);
   ```
2. Refresh once at startup, and then periodically. Recommended refresh interval is hourly: for details, see [Best Practices for Managing UID2 Tokens](../sharing/sharing-best-practices.md#key-refresh-cadence).

   ```java
   client.refresh();
   ```
3. Senders: 
   1. Call the following:

      ```java
      EncryptionDataResponse encrypted = client.encrypt(rawUid);
      ```
   2. If encryption succeeded, send the UID2 token to the receiver:   

      ```java
      if (encrypted.isSuccess()) 
      { 
         //send encrypted.getEncryptedData() to receiver
      } 
      else 
      {
         //check encrypted.getStatus() for the failure reason
      }
      ```
4. Receivers: 
   1. Call the following:

      ```java
      DecryptionResponse decrypted = client.decrypt(uidToken);
      ```
   2. If decryption succeeded, use the raw UID2:

      ```java    
      if (decrypted.isSuccess()) 
      {
         //use decrypted.getUid() 
      } 
      else 
      {
       //check decrypted.getStatus() for the failure reason 
      }
      ```
