# POST /identity/map

Maps multiple email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes to their raw UID2s. You can also use this endpoint to check for updates to opt-out information, check when a raw UID2 can be refreshed, or view the previous UID2 if the current UID2 is less than 90 days old.

Used by: This endpoint is used mainly by advertisers and data providers. For details, see [Advertiser/Data Provider Integration Overview](../guides/integration-advertiser-dataprovider-overview.md).

For details about the UID2 opt-out workflow and how users can opt out, see [User Opt-Out](../getting-started/gs-opt-out.md).

## Version

This documentation is for the latest version of this endpoint, version 3.

If needed, documentation is also available for the previous version: see [POST /identity/map (v2)](post-identity-map-v2.md).

## Batch Size and Request Parallelization Requirements

Here's what you need to know:

- The maximum request size is 1MB.
- To map a large number of email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes, send them in *sequential* batches with a maximum batch size of 5,000 items per batch.
- Unless you are using a <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-private-operator">Private Operator</Link>, do not send batches in parallel. In other words, use a single HTTP connection and send batches of hashed or unhashed <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-dii">directly identifying information (DII)</Link> values consecutively, without creating multiple parallel connections.
- Be sure to store mappings of email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes.<br/>Not storing mappings could increase processing time drastically when you have to map millions of email addresses or phone numbers. Recalculating only those mappings that actually need to be updated, however, reduces the total processing time because only about 1/365th of UID2s need to be updated daily. See also [Advertiser/Data Provider Integration Overview](../guides/integration-advertiser-dataprovider-overview.md) and [FAQs for Advertisers and Data Providers](../getting-started/gs-faqs.md#faqs-for-advertisers-and-data-providers).

### Request Examples

The following are unencrypted JSON request body examples to the `POST /identity/map` endpoint:

```json
{
    "email":[
        "user@example.com",
        "user2@example.com"
    ],
    "phone":[
        "+12345678901",
        "+441234567890"
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "email_hash":[
        "tMmiiTI7IaAcPpQPFQ65uMVCWH8av9jw4cwf/F5HVRQ=",
        "KzsrnOhCq4tqbGFMsflgS7ig1QLRr0nFJrcrEIlOlbU="
    ],
    "phone_hash":[
        "EObwtHBUqDNZR33LNSMdtt5cafsYFuGmuY4ZLenlue4=",
        "Rx8SW4ZyKqbPypXmswDNuq0SPxStFXBTG/yvPns/2NQ="
    ]
}
```

Here's an encrypted request example to the `POST /identity/map` endpoint for a phone number:

```sh
echo '{"phone": ["+12345678901", "+441234567890"]}' | python3 uid2_request.py https://prod.uidapi.com/v3/identity/map [YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY] [YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]
```

For details, and code examples in different programming languages, see [Encrypting Requests and Decrypting Responses](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md).

## Decrypted JSON Response Format

:::note
The response is encrypted only if the HTTP status code is 200. Otherwise, the response is not encrypted.
:::

A successful decrypted response returns the current raw UID2s, previous raw UID2s, and refresh timestamps for the specified email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes. 

The response arrays preserve the order of input arrays. Each element in the response array maps directly to the element at the same index in the corresponding request array. This ensures that you can reliably associate results with their corresponding inputs based on array position.

Input values that cannot be mapped to a raw UID2 are mapped to an error object with the reason for unsuccessful mapping. An unsuccessful mapping occurs if the DII is invalid or has been opted out from the UID2 ecosystem. In these cases, the response status is `success` but no raw UID2 is returned.

The following example shows input and response.

Input:

```json
{
    "email": [
        "user@example.com"      // Corresponding UID2 rotated in the last 90 days
        "user2@example.com"     // Corresponding UID2 rotated more than 90 days ago
        "invalid email string"  // Invalid identifier
        "optout@example.com"    // DII is opted out
    ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "body":{
        "email": [
            {
                "u": "AdvIvSiaum0P5s3X/7X8h8sz+OhF2IG8DNbEnkWSbYM=",
                "p": "EObwtHBUqDNZR33LNSMdtt5cafsYFuGmuY4ZLenlue4=",
                "r": 1735689600000
            },
            {
                "u": "IbW4n6LIvtDj/8fCESlU0QG9K/fH63UdcTkJpAG8fIQ=",
                "p": null,
                "r": 1735862400000
            },
            { "e": "invalid identifier" },
            { "e": "optout" }
        ],
      "email_hash": [],
      "phone": [],
      "phone_hash": []
    },
    "status":"success"
}
```

| `e`      | string    | The reason for being unable to map the DII to a raw UID2. One of two possible values:<ul><li>`optout`</li><li>`invalid identifier`</li></ul> |

### Response Status Codes

The following table lists the `status` property values and their HTTP status code equivalents.

| Status | HTTP Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| `unauthorized` | 401 | The request did not include a bearer token, included an invalid bearer token, or included a bearer token unauthorized to perform the requested operation. |

If the `status` value is anything other than `success`, the `message` field provides additional information about the issue.
