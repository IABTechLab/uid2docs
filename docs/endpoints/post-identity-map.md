# POST /identity/map

Maps multiple email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes to their raw UID2s. You can also use this endpoint to check for updates to opt-out information, check when a raw UID2 can be refreshed, or view the previous UID2 if the current UID2 is less than 90 days old.

Used by: This endpoint is used mainly by advertisers and data providers. For details, see [Advertiser/Data Provider Integration Overview](../guides/integration-advertiser-dataprovider-overview.md).

For details about the UID2 opt-out workflow and how users can opt out, see [User Opt-Out](../getting-started/gs-opt-out.md).

## Version

This documentation is for the latest version of this endpoint, version 3.

If needed, documentation is also available for the previous version: see [POST /identity/map (v2)](post-identity-map-v2.md).

## Batch Size and Request Parallelization Requirements

Here's what you need to know:

- The maximum request size is 1MB.
- To map a large number of email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes, send them in *sequential* batches with a maximum batch size of 5,000 items per batch.
- Unless you are using a <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-private-operator">Private Operator</Link>, do not send batches in parallel. In other words, use a single HTTP connection and send batches of hashed or unhashed <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-dii">directly identifying information (DII)</Link> values consecutively, without creating multiple parallel connections.
- Be sure to store mappings of email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes.<br/>Not storing mappings could increase processing time drastically when you have to map millions of email addresses or phone numbers. Recalculating only those mappings that actually need to be updated, however, reduces the total processing time because only about 1/365th of UID2s need to be updated daily. See also [Advertiser/Data Provider Integration Overview](../guides/integration-advertiser-dataprovider-overview.md) and [FAQs for Advertisers and Data Providers](../getting-started/gs-faqs.md#faqs-for-advertisers-and-data-providers).

### Request Examples

The following are unencrypted JSON request body examples to the `POST /identity/map` endpoint:

```json
{
    "email":[
        "user@example.com",
        "user2@example.com"
    ],
    "phone":[
        "+12345678901",
        "+441234567890"
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "email_hash":[
        "tMmiiTI7IaAcPpQPFQ65uMVCWH8av9jw4cwf/F5HVRQ=",
        "KzsrnOhCq4tqbGFMsflgS7ig1QLRr0nFJrcrEIlOlbU="
    ],
    "phone_hash":[
        "EObwtHBUqDNZR33LNSMdtt5cafsYFuGmuY4ZLenlue4=",
        "Rx8SW4ZyKqbPypXmswDNuq0SPxStFXBTG/yvPns/2NQ="
    ]
}
```

Here's an encrypted request example to the `POST /identity/map` endpoint for phone numbers:

```sh
echo '{"phone": ["+12345678901", "+441234567890"]}' | python3 uid2_request.py https://prod.uidapi.com/v3/identity/map [YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY] [YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]
```

For details, and code examples in different programming languages, see [Encrypting Requests and Decrypting Responses](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md).

## Decrypted JSON Response Format

:::note
The response is encrypted only if the HTTP status code is 200. Otherwise, the response is not encrypted.
:::

A successful decrypted response returns the current raw UID2s, previous raw UID2s, and refresh timestamps for the specified email addresses, phone numbers, or their respective hashes. 

The response arrays preserve the order of input arrays. Each element in the response array maps directly to the element at the same index in the corresponding request array. This ensures that you can reliably associate results with their corresponding inputs based on array position.

Input values that cannot be mapped to a raw UID2 are mapped to an error object with the reason for unsuccessful mapping. An unsuccessful mapping occurs if the DII is invalid or has been opted out from the UID2 ecosystem. In these cases, the response status is `success` but no raw UID2 is returned.

The following example shows the input and corresponding response.

Input:

```json
{
    "email": [
        "user@example.com",      // Corresponding UID2 rotated in the last 90 days
        "user2@example.com",     // Corresponding UID2 rotated more than 90 days ago
        "invalid email string",  // Invalid identifier
        "optout@example.com"     // DII is opted out
    ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "body":{
        "email": [
            {
                "u": "AdvIvSiaum0P5s3X/7X8h8sz+OhF2IG8DNbEnkWSbYM=",
                "p": "EObwtHBUqDNZR33LNSMdtt5cafsYFuGmuY4ZLenlue4=",
                "r": 1735689600000
            },
            {
                "u": "IbW4n6LIvtDj/8fCESlU0QG9K/fH63UdcTkJpAG8fIQ=",
                "p": null,
                "r": 1735862400000
            },
            { "e": "invalid identifier" },
            { "e": "optout" }
        ],
      "email_hash": [],
      "phone": [],
      "phone_hash": []
    },
    "status": "success"
}
```

### Key Differences Between v2 and v3

The following table shows key differences between the versions.

| Feature                        | v2 Implementation                           | v3 Implementation                          |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|

| Previous UID2 Access       | Not available                               | Available for 90 days        |

### Required Changes

To upgrade from an earlier version to version 3, follow these steps:

1. [Update Endpoint URL](#1-update-endpoint-url)
2. [Update v3 Response Parsing Logic](#2-update-v3-response-parsing-logic)
3. [Replace Salt Bucket Monitoring with Refresh Timestamp Logic](#3-replace-salt-bucket-monitoring-with-refresh-timestamp-logic)

#### 1. Update Endpoint URL

Update any reference to the endpoint URL so that it references the /v3/ implementation, as shown in the following example.

```python
# Before (v2)
url = '/v2/identity/map'

# After (v3) 
url = '/v3/identity/map'
```

#### 2. Update v3 Response Parsing Logic

Update the logic for parsing the response, as shown in the following example.

v2 Response Parsing:
```python
# v2: Process mapped/unmapped objects with identifier lookup
for item in response['body']['mapped']:
    raw_uid = item['advertising_id']
    bucket_id = item['bucket_id']
    original_identifier = item['identifier']
    # Store mapping using identifier as key
    store_mapping(original_identifier, raw_uid, bucket_id)
```

v3 Response Parsing:
```python
# v3: Process array-indexed responses
for index, item in enumerate(response['body']['email']):
    original_email = request_emails[index]  # Use array index to correlate
    if 'u' in item:
        # Successfully mapped
        current_uid = item['u']
        previous_uid = item.get('p')  # Available for 90 days after rotation, otherwise None
        refresh_from = item['r']
        store_mapping(original_email, current_uid, previous_uid, refresh_from)
    elif 'e' in item:
        # Handle unmapped with reason
        handle_unmapped(original_email, item['e'])
```

#### 3. Replace Salt Bucket Monitoring with Refresh Timestamp Logic

Update your code for salt bucket monitoring, replacing it with code that checks the `refresh_from` timestamp to determine raw UID2s that are due for refresh.

The following example shows an implementation of the v3 approach for checking refresh timestamps:

```python
import time

def is_refresh_needed(mapping):
    now = int(time.time() * 1000)  # Convert to milliseconds
    return now >= mapping['refresh_from']

# Check individual mappings for refresh needs
to_remap = [mapping for mapping in mappings if is_refresh_needed(mapping)]
remap_identities(to_remap)
```
