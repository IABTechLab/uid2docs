# UID2 Sharing

In UID2, sharing is a process for distributing either [raw UID2s](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-raw-uid2) or [UID2 tokens](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-raw-uid2) between UID2 participants.

All instances where a raw UID2 or UID2 token is shared with another participant fall under the definition of sharing. All sharing participants must meet the [legal requirements](#legal-requirements-for-uid2-sharing) specified in the following section, [Legal Requirements for UID2 Sharing](#legal-requirements-for-uid2-sharing).

Technical requirements vary according to your role and the implementation approach, and are covered in the instructions for each scenario in the sharing documentation. For a summary of scenarios, see [Sharing Scenarios](sharing/sharing-overview.md#sharing-scenarios) in the Sharing Overview.

## Legal Requirements for UID2 Sharing

:::important
UID2 sharing is allowed only for UID2 participants who have agreed to comply with the UID2 Participation Policy.
:::

Before you can participate with UID2 sharing you, as the participant, must have in place an effective UID2 agreement that incorporates the UID2 Participation Policy, or have entered into a separate addendum to an effective UID2 agreement incorporating the Participation Policy. If you haven't satisfied this requirement, you cannot proceed with UID2 sharing.

If you still need to satisfy this requirement, or if you have any questions, please reach out to [UID2partners@thetradedesk.com](mailto:UID2partners@thetradedesk.com).

If you've agreed to comply with the UID2 Participation Policy, you can proceed with UID2 sharing by following the documentation: see [UID2 Sharing](/docs/category/uid2-sharing).
