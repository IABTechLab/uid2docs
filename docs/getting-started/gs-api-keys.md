# Getting Started&#8212;API Keys

Each UID2 <a href="/docs/intro#participants">participant</a> has a client key, also called an API key, that allows the participant to connect to the [Operator Service](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-operator-service) and call API endpoints.

The client key identifies the participant to the UID2 service.

Here is some information about API keys:
- One UID2 participant can have multiple keys.
- Each key has a set of permissions that determine which endpoints it can be used on.

As part of getting your UID2 account set up, one or more API keys will be issued to you. For details of who to talk to, see [Contact Info](gs-account-setup.md#contact-info).
