# API Keys

Each UID2 <a href="/docs/intro#participants">participant</a> has a client key, also called an API key. Each key has a corresponding [client secret](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-client-secret), a value known only to the participant and the UID2 service.

The client key and client secret allow the participant to connect to the [Operator Service](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-operator-service) and call API endpoints. These values identify the participant to the service.

Here is some information about API keys and client secrets:
- One UID2 participant can have multiple keys.
- Each key has a set of permissions that determine which endpoints it can be used on.
- Each key has a corresponding client secret.
- Most API endpoints require both client key and client secret for authentication. For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](gs-auth.md).

As part of getting your UID2 account set up, one or more API keys, each with a corresponding client secret, will be issued to you. For details of who to talk to, see [Contact Info](gs-account-setup.md#contact-info).
