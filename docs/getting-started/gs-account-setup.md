## Contact Info

To get access to the UID2 framework, contact the appropriate team at The Trade Desk listed below.

## Account Setup Details

Once you've expressed interest in UID2, someone will contact you to help work out the details.

All participants will need to provide at least the following information:
* Name
* Email address
* Company name
* Name and contact information for an authorized individual who can sign the contract.

### Client-Side Implementation for Publishers

If you're a publisher, and you determine that you want to implement UID2 so that tokens are generated on the client side, you'll also need to provide a list of **domain names** for your sites. This is a security measure, for client-side implementation only.

:::tip
Only root-level domains are required for account setup. For example, if you're going to implement UID2 to generate tokens on the client side on example.com, shop.example.com, and example.org, you only need to provide the domain names example.com and example.org.

## Credentials

When you've signed a contract for participating in UID2, you'll be issued with [UID2 credentials](gs-credentials.md) and other information for getting up and running with UID2.

## API Version

The current version of the UID2 API is UID2 API v2.
