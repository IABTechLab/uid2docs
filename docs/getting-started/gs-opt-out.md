Kimberly: So when you opt out of the UID2 service we will never give the UID2 again, we will never generate anything from the UID2 service. It doesn’t mean to say, though, that yourUID2 won't be used. So that's the key part that I don't necessarily want to call out right now, because how we mandate what the UID2 is going to get used for once it's opted out is what we're trying to figure out with Legal. Like, if you can use it for target advertising. But what does target advertising mean? There's a lot of definitions. Because, if we asked an advertiser to stop using that UID2, that's a lot of work -- like a lot, a lot a lot of work. 
So that's what we need to figure out from that perspective. But I think the biggest thing is that we could say, Okay, you go to transparent advertising. You opt out. You can opt out of your email address and/or of your phone number. This opts you out of the UID2 system. And then I would also want to say that any publisher or advertiser opt-out, they shouldn't ever… if you opted out of a publisher's site, we recommend that the publisher or the advertiser, whoever the participant, does not create or generate a UID2, because you opted out of them specifically. It's not mandatory, we don't do checks or anything like that, but at the end of the day, that's our recommendation, is that if I go to Disney and I opt out of Disney, that Disney doesn't then use my email address to generate a UID2.

Gen: right. But we just kind of gently make the point that that's the game, but we don’t enforce that, we’re not the UID2 police.
Kimberly: Right. The wording has to be, that’s our recommendation, not anything else.
And then, the other thing that we always get a lot of questions on is what happens if I’m a publisher, and I want to send you my opted out users. We don't do that. From a UID2 standpoint you’re opted out only from transparent advertising: we do not integrate with other publisher-specific opted out sites.
The only way to opt out is through transparent advertising.com, and that's it.
Gen: Oh, okay, so if a user…
31:47
Kimberly: One question that we get all the time is - a publisher, let's say, Disney, for instance. Disney will ask us -- we have these five opted out users. We want to send it to you so that you opt them out of UID. But that's not what we do. If you opt yourself out of Disney, we then say, just don't ever even create a UID. But we don't want to know that this user’s opted out of Disney. We don't care who's opted out of Disney. We only care who's opted out of UID2.
32:20
Gen: I see. Okay. So if the user wants to opt out of UID2, they have to either say no In the first place, when they're asked. They're explicitly asked, and they say no, so they’re never opted in -- so that's actually not opting out.
But if they do opt in, the only way they can opt out is by going to transparent advertising.org, if they do it. It's we message that to anybody, to all… who do we message it to?
Kimberly: Yeah. So that's where those 3 steps on this page that I said. We should tell all DSPs that they are opted out. And then you can just like, go to the DSP page. And then if an advertiser tries to call identity/map on an opted-out user, they will not get the UID2, they will get an opted out response, and if you try to refresh or call token/generate on a UID2 token, you will not get the token, you'll get the opt-out response.
Gen: Okay, good. That covers it. so maybe we could have a diagram later on. But I’m going to just try and put together a blurb first, anyway.
