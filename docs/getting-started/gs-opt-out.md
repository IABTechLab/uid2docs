# User Opt-Out

Many different publishers, advertisers, web sites, and other companies use UID2. Different publishers might have different opt-out processes for their individual sites; however, UID2 as a whole has very specific opt-out processes that all UID2 [participants](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-participant) are expected to honor.

## How Users Can Opt Out of UID2

Consumers can always opt out of UID2 completely in the [Transparency and Control Portal](https://www.transparentadvertising.com/). Choose email address or phone number, enter the data, and follow the prompts.

:::tip
To opt out both your email address and your phone number, do them one at a time.

## Results of Opting Out of UID2

When a consumer opts out of UID2, that individual's UID2 token is no longer accepted for targeted advertising anywhere in the UID2 ecosystem. However, note these key points:

- **Short delay**&#8212;Because there is a delay in the time it takes to process and refresh UID2 information, the UID2 token for a user who has opted out might be in play for a short while after opt-out.

  **Publishers**: As each publisher periodically refreshes the UID2 token, the publisher receives in response the information that the user has opted out. At this point the publisher should no longer use the UID2 token.
  
  **Advertisers**: In addition, advertisers periodically refresh their UID2 data. When the opt-out information is propagated, the UID2 token is no longer accepted.

- **Individual site logins not affected**&#8212;It's important to understand that when a consumer opts out of UID2, this doesn't cancel any login that the consumer might have created on one or more participating UID2 sites. Any login or account that a user creates on a participant site is not related to the management of UID2.

## Difference Between Opting Out from a Single Publisher and Opting Out of UID2

If a consumer opts out of a specific participant site, UID2 guidelines recommend that the participant no longer uses that consumer's information to create or generate a UID2, because the consumer opted out of that site specifically. Those are the recommendations of the UID2 framework, but we cannot enforce that on individual participants.

In addition, if a user opts out from a specific publisher, that information is not relayed to UID2. Opting out from a specific publisher does not opt a consumer out of UID2.

The sure way for a consumer to fully opt out of UID2 is in the [Transparency and Control Portal](https://www.transparentadvertising.com/).

## Opt-Out Is Final

Currently, if you opt out of UID2, there is no way to opt back in again. As a consumer, if you want to participate in UID2 you could use a different email address or phone number.

## Opt-Out Workflow
