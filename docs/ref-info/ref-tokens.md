# UID2 Tokens and Refresh Tokens

When a publisher sends a user's <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-dii">DII</Link>&#8212;hashed or unhashed email addresses or phone numbers&#8212;to the UID2 Operator, whether via one of the UID2 SDKs or the [POST&nbsp;/token/generate](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md) endpoint, the UID2 Operator converts the DII to a <a href="glossary-uid#gl-raw-uid2">raw UID2</a>, encrypts it into a <a href="glossary-uid#gl-uid2-token">UID2 token</a>, and returns the UID2 token with associated values, including a refresh token. The publisher can then use the UID2 token in the bidstream.

## UID2 Tokens: Key Information

Here are some key points about UID2 tokens:

- The UID2 token is a unique value: no two UID2 tokens are the same.
- UID2 tokens are case sensitive.
- The token value is an <a href="glossary-uid#gl-opaque">opaque</a> string: do not make any assumptions about the format or length of the string.
- The token generation logic checks for user opt-out. If the user has opted out of UID2, no UID2 token is generated. For details, see [User Opt-Out](../getting-started/gs-opt-out.md).
- The token has a limited life, but can be refreshed using the refresh token.
- You can refresh many times, to get a new UID2 token and corresponding new refresh token, as long as the current UID2 token is always refreshed before the current refresh token expires.
- If the token has expired, or as an alternative to refreshing an existing token, you can always generate a new UID2 token from the original hashed or unhashed email address or phone number.
- Publishers send UID2 tokens in the bidstream.
- Refreshing a UID2 token does not invalidate/expire the original or previous UID2 token. You can still use the earlier token until it expires.

## Refresh Tokens: Key Information

Here are some key points about refresh tokens:

- A refresh token is a string that is issued along with the <a href="glossary-uid#gl-uid2-token">UID2 token</a>.
- Refresh tokens are case sensitive.
- The token value is <a href="glossary-uid#gl-opaque">opaque</a>: do not make any assumptions about the format or length of the string.
- You can use the refresh token to generate a new UID2 token and new refresh token before the current refresh token expires.
- Using refresh tokens is optional: you could choose to generate a new token from DII each time rather than refreshing an existing token. 
- Token refresh can be managed in a variety of ways, such as:
  - With a UID2 SDK (see [SDK Functionality](../sdks/summary-sdks.md#sdk-functionality))
  - By calling the [POST&nbsp;/token/refresh](../endpoints/post-token-refresh.md) endpoint
  - By using the UID2 Prebid.js module (see [UID2 Integration Overview for Prebid.js](../guides/integration-prebid.md))
- The [POST&nbsp;/token/refresh](../endpoints/post-token-refresh.md) endpoint does not require authentication with your UID2 credentials.
- When a new UID2 token is generated and returned, a new refresh token is returned along with it.
- In most cases, you can refresh tokens on the client side, even if the token was generated on the server side. For details about refresh functionality for the various SDKs, see [SDK Functionality](../sdks/summary-sdks.md#sdk-functionality) (*Refresh UID2 Token* column).
- When the UID2 Operator service receives the refresh token with a request for a new UID2 token, it checks for user opt-out. If the user has opted out of UID2, no new UID2 token is generated. For details, see [User Opt-Out](../getting-started/gs-opt-out.md).

### Recommended Token Refresh Frequency

The recommended refresh interval is hourly.

To determine when to refresh, you can use the timestamp of the `refresh_from` field in the response to the [POST&nbsp;/token/generate](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md) endpoint (see [Successful Response](../endpoints/post-token-generate.md#successful-response)) or [POST&nbsp;/token/refresh](../endpoints/post-token-refresh.md) endpoint (see [Successful Response With Tokens](../endpoints/post-token-refresh.md#successful-response-with-tokens)). The value of this field is a timestamp in UNIX time, expressed in milliseconds.
