# UID2 Guiding Principles

The UID2 framework has the following principles as its foundation:

- **First-party relationships**: UID2 enables advertisers to activate their first-party data on publisher websites across the open internet.

- **Non-proprietary (universal) standard**: All [participants](#participants) in the advertising ecosystem who execute an appropriate participation agreement can access UID2.

- **Open source**: The source code for the UID2 [components](#components) is publicly available.

- **Interoperable**: The framework allows other identity solutions (commercial and proprietary) to integrate and provide UID2 tokens with their offerings.

- **Secure and encrypted data**: UID2 leverages multiple layers of security to help protect user and other participant data.

- **Consumer control**: Consumers can opt out of UID2 at any time through the [Transparency and Control Portal](https://www.transparentadvertising.com/).

## Technical Design Principles

The UID2 framework is built on the following technical principles:

- **Distributed integration**: Multiple certified integration paths provide options for publishers, advertisers, and third-party data providers to manage and exchange UID2 tokens.

- **Decentralized storage**: The framework does not have centralized storage for personal data (<Link href="ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-dii">DII</Link>) mappings. All participants maintain only their own data.

- **Lean infrastructure**: The UID2 system is light and inexpensive to operate.

- **Internet scale**: The UID2 infrastructure can scale to address the continuously increasing needs of [participants](#participants) and to meet the performance demands of specific geographic regions.

- **Self-reliant**: UID2 does not rely on external services for the processing of real-time bidding (RTB) data.
