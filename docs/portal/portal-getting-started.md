# Getting Started with the UID2 Portal

As part of requesting a UID2 Portal account, you must provide some information about yourself and your company, such as name and type of business.

Once you've initiated the request, there are two steps before you can actually access the UID2 Portal:

1. You'll get a confirmation email, which you must click to verify your email account.
1. Your account is created. This might take a few days. When the account is ready, you'll get a confirmation email and can then go into your account to verify the details, set up participants and teams, and configure your settings for UID2 Sharing partnerships.

If at any time you need assistance with the onboarding process, ask your UID2 contact.

<!-- It includes the following:

- [Log In for the First Time](#log-in-for-the-first-time)

1. Click **Request Account**.

2. On the Request Account page, provide the following information about yourself:

   - First name
   - Last name
   - Email address

3. Create and confirm your password and then click **Continue**.

4. On the Participant Information page, provide your name and the type of participant, out of the following:

   - Data Provider

5. Click the **Terms and Conditions** link to review the details.

   You are returned to the Participant Information page.

3. Check the box to agree to the terms and conditions, and then click **Request Account**.

When you've requested your account, two things happen:

2. Then, your account goes for approval. The process might take a few days. When the approval process is complete, you'll receive a confirmation email with a link to log in to the UID2 Portal.

## Log In for the First Time

When your account is authorized, and you log in for the first time, the first step is to review and accept the UID2 Sharing Portal Terms of Service.

When you've scrolled to the bottom of the document, the **Accept** button is enabled so that you can accept and continue.

## Set Up Account Information

The first step is to set up general information for your account, such as participant name and type. This information is defaulted from the data you entered when you created your account.

If you need to make any changes, contact UID2 Support.

When you've verified the account information, the next step is to set up your team. See [Team Members](team-members.md).

## Reset Password

If you forget your password, just click the **Forgot Password** link on the login page. Provide your email address, then look for the password reset message in your email account.
