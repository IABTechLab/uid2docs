# Getting Started with the UID2 Portal

As part of requesting a UID2 Portal account, you must provide some information about yourself and your company, such as name and type of business.

Once you've initiated the request, there are two steps before you can actually access the UID2 Portal:

1. You'll get a confirmation email. Click the button in the email to verify your account.
1. Your account is created. This might take a few days. When the account is ready, you'll get a confirmation email and can then go into your account to verify the details, set up participants and teams, and configure your settings for UID2 sharing permissions.

If at any time you need assistance with the onboarding process, ask your UID2 contact.
