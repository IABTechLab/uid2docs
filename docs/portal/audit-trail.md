# Audit Trail

In the UID2 Portal, Admin users can access the **Audit Trail** page to view a detailed log of all past actions performed by or on behalf of the current participant. The table displays the action performed, the user who performed it, the time it was performed, and whether it succeeded. The Audit Trail table also supports sorting and searching.
