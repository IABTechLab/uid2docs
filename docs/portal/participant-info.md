# Participant Information

As part of requesting a UID2 Portal account, you must provide some information about yourself and your company, such as name and type of business.

<!-- Once you've initiated the request, there are two steps before you can actually access the UID2 Portal:

1. You'll get a confirmation email, which you must click to verify your email account.
1. Your account is created. This might take a few days. When the account is ready, you'll get a confirmation email and can then go into your account to verify the details, set up participants and teams, and configure your settings for UID2 Sharing partnerships.

If at any time you need assistance with the onboarding process, ask your UID2 contact. -->

<!-- It includes the following:

- [Before Creating Your Account](#before-creating-your-account)
- [Request an Account](#request-an-account)
- [Log In for the First Time](#log-in-for-the-first-time)
- [Set Up Account Information](#set-up-account-information)
- [Reset Password](#reset-password) -->


When you have access to the portal, click **Participant Info** to review general information for your account, such as participant name and type. This information is defaulted from the data you entered when you created your account.

If you need to make any changes, contact UID2 Support.

When you've verified the account information, the next step is to set up your team. See [Team Members](team-members.md).
