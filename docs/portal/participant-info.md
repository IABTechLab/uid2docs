# Participant Information

As part of requesting a UID2 Portal account, you must provide some information about yourself and your company, such as name and type of business.

When you have access to the portal, click **Participant Info** to review general information for your account, such as <a href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-sharing-participant">participant</a> name and type. The information you provided when you created the account is displayed.

If you need to make any changes, contact UID2 Support.

When you've verified the account information, the next step is to set up your team. See [Team Members](team-members.md).
