# Participant Information

As part of requesting a UID2 Portal account, you must provide some information about yourself and your company, such as name and type of business.

In the UID2 Portal, some of this information is displayed. When you have access, verify that the information is accurate.

To access the page, go to the top right of the UID2 Portal user interface where your name is displayed. Click the down arrow and choose **Participant Information**.

For an illustration, see [UID2 Portal Structure](portal-overview.md#uid2-portal-structure).

Review general information for your account, such as <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-sharing-participant">participant</Link> name and type. The information you provided when you created the account is displayed. 

If you need to make any changes, contact UID2 Support.

When you've verified the account information, the next step is to set up your team. See [Team Members](team-members.md).
