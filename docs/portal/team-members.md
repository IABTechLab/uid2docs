# Team Members

In the UID2 Portal, on the **Team Members** page, users with the Admin role can perform all activities relating to configuring individuals who you want to authorize for access to your account, including the following:

- [Add a Team Member](#add-a-team-member)
- [Resend an Invitation to a Team Member](#resend-an-invitation-to-a-team-member) 
- [Edit Information for a Team Member](#edit-information-for-a-team-member) 
- [Remove a Team Member](#remove-a-team-member)

## Accessing the Team Members Page

To access the Team Members page, go to the top right of the UID2 Portal user interface where your name is displayed. Click the down arrow and choose **Manage Team Members**.

For each team member, the following information is displayed:
- Name
- Email
- Job Function
- Role
- Actions: the available actions are **Edit** or **Delete**.

For an illustration, see [UID2 Portal Structure](portal-overview.md#uid2-portal-structure).

## User Roles

Each team member has one of the roles shown in the following table.

| Role | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
| Admin | Users with the Admin role can perform all activities related to UID2 participation, as summarized in the [UID2 Portal Overview](portal-overview.md), for the current participant organization. |
| Operations | Users with the Operations role can perform most of the same actions as Admin users. However, they cannot add, modify, or remove team members. Instead, they have read-only access to the **Manage Team Members** page. |

User roles can only be modified by users with the Admin role. For details, see [Edit Information for a Team Member](#edit-information-for-a-team-member).
