- Add, modify, or remove additional team members: see [Add a Team Member](#add-a-team-member)
- Add, modify, or remove email contacts: see [Email Contacts](email-contacts.md).

## Add a Team Member

Complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your UID2 Portal account.
1. On the Team Members page, click Add Team Member.
1. Enter the first name, last name, email, and job function.
1. Click Save Team Member.

   The team member is added to the list, with Pending status. (**GWH_KT_09 pending what? janesaoirse@gmail.com I didn't get a confirmation email so it isn't that.**)

## Resend an Invitation to a Team Member

If you added a team member, you might need to resend the invitation. For example, perhaps the team member didn't receive the invitation or accidentally deleted it, or the invitation has expired.

To re-send the invitation for a team member, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click **Resend Invitation**. The status updates to **Invitation Sent**.

**(GWH_KT_10 What needs to happen next?)**

## Edit Information for a Team Member

To edit information for a team member, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click the Edit (pencil) icon.

Update the information, and then save. (**GWH_KT_11 it doesn't work for me**)

## Remove a Team Member

To remove someone from the team, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click the delete (trashcan) icon. (**GWH_KT_12 it doesn't work for me**) (**GWH_KT_13 also: is there a confirmation message?**)

## Log In for the First Time as a Team Member

If you were added as a new team member, when you log in for the first time, the first step is to review and accept the UID2 Sharing Portal Terms of Service.

When you've reviewed the terms of service document, scrolling down to the bottom, the **Accept** button is enabled so that you can accept and continue.
