In the UID2 Portal, on the Team Members page, you can perform all activities relating to configuring individuals who you want to authorize for access to your account. Each team member is an administrator for the account, with the following rights:

- To add, modify, or remove additional team members.
- To add, modify, or remove email contacts.
- To add or remove sharing relationships and sharing settings.

(GWH_KT is the above accurate? Maybe I should check with the team. I don't think the wireframes cover this level of detail re permissions.)

# Add a Team Member

To add a team member, complete the following steps:

1. Click Add Team Member.
1. Enter the first name, last name, email, and job function.
1. Click Save Team Member.

   The team member is added to the list, with Pending status. (**GWH_KT pending what? janesaoirse@gmail.com I didn't get a confirmation email so it isn't that.**)

# Resend an Invitation to a Team Member

If you added a team member, you might need to resend the invitation. For example, perhaps the team member didn't receive the invitation or accidentally deleted it, or the invitation has expired.

To re-send the invitation for a team member, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click **Resend Invitation**. The status updates to **Invitation Sent**.

**What needs to happen next?**

# Remove a Team Member

To remove someone from the team, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click the delete (trashcan) icon. (**GWH_KT it doesn't work for me**)
