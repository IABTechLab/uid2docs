# Team Members

In the UID2 Portal, on the **Team Members** page, Admin users can perform all activities relating to configuring individuals who you want to authorize for access to your account, including the following:

- [Add a Team Member](#add-a-team-member)
- [Resend an Invitation to a Team Member](#resend-an-invitation-to-a-team-member) 
- [Edit Information for a Team Member](#edit-information-for-a-team-member) 
- [Remove a Team Member](#remove-a-team-member)

## Accessing the Team Members Page

To access the Team Members page, go to the top right of the UID2 Portal user interface where your name is displayed. Click the down arrow and choose **Manage Team Members**.

For an illustration, see [UID2 Portal Structure](portal-overview.md#uid2-portal-structure).

## User Roles

Each team member has one of two user roles: Admin or Operations. Admins can perform all activities related to UID2 participation, as summarized in the [UID2 Portal Overview](portal-overview.md).

Users with the Operations role can perform most of the same actions as Admin users. However, they cannot add, modify, or remove team members. Instead, they have read-only access to the **Manage Team Members** page.

User Roles can only be modified by users with the Admin role, by following: [Edit Information for a Team Member](#edit-information-for-a-team-member).
