# Sharing Relationships

Configuring one or more (or many) sharing relationship opens the door to you being able to share UID2 information with other UID2 participants.

This page provides supporting information about configuring your sharing relationships.

>NOTE: Configuring a sharing relationship with another participant doesn't mean that data is shared. It only makes it possible. Information is only shared when you explicitly send it to another participant, or another participant sends it to you.

There are many options so that you can create the exact sharing relationships that you want:

- You can share with one, multiple, or all participants in a specific category (Publishers, Advertisers, DSPs, or Data Providers)
- You can create a sharing relationship only with current participants or, optionally, you can also choose to automatically create relationships with future participants that also choose to share.
- You can choose to have your name on the sharing list, so that others can create sharing relationships with you, or you can participate in sharing without your name appearing on the list.
- You can generate a Sharing Number that you can share with specific participants you want to share with. They can use the Sharing Number to create a sharing relationship with you even if you chose to be private.
