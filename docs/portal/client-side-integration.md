# Client-Side Integration

In the UID2 Portal, you can specify people from your organization whom we should notify for information about the latest updates and releases for UID2. You can set up individual email addresses, or reference an email group that you've set up internally to notify multiple individuals in your organization.

Adding email groups rather than individuals has some benefits:
- It's an efficient way to keep multiple people notified without having to create a lot of individual entries.
- You can manage the list externally, as part of managing your internal email configuration, outside the UID2 Portal.

>NOTE: Email contacts cannot log in to the UID2 Portal or modify the account. They only receive information notices. If an email contact wants to be removed, that action must be done by a team member.
