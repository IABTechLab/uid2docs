# Client-Side Integration

In the UID2 Portal, if you want an implementation that generates UID2 tokens on the client side, you'll need to define the following:

- Key pairs. In your implementation, you'll share the public key.  For details, see [Subscription ID and Public Key](getting-started/gs-credentials.md#subscription-id-and-public-key).
- A complete list of root-level domain names for your sites. This is a security measure, for client-side implementation only. For details, see [Client-Side Implementation for Publishers](../getting-started/gs-account-setup.md#client-side-implementation-for-publishers).

Client-side implementation options include the following:
- The JavaScript SDK: see [Client-Side Integration Guide for JavaScript](../guides/publisher-client-side.md).
- For publishers, the Prebid.js client-side integration: see [UID2 Client-Side Integration Guide for Prebid.js](../guides/integration-prebid-client-side.md).

On the Client-Side Integration page you can perform all activities relating to setting up and managing these values, including:

- [Adding a Key Pair](#adding-a-key-pair)
- [Copying a Public Key](#copying-a-public-key)
- [Changing the Name of a Public Key](#changing-the-name-of-a-key-pair)
- [Deleting a Key Pair](#deleting-a-key-pair)
- [Adding a Top-Level Domain](#adding-a-top-level-domain)
- [Modifying a Top-Level Domain](#modifying-a-top-level-domain)
- [Deleting a Top-Level Domain](#deleting-a-top-level-domain)

## Changing the Name of a Key Pair

When you've created a public key, the only value you can change is the name. To change the actual key, you'll need to create a new key pair.

TIP
Only root-level domains are required for account setup. For example, if you're going to implement UID2 to generate tokens on the client side on example.com, shop.example.com, and example.org, you
