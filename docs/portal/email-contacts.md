# Email Contacts

In the UID2 Portal, you can specify people from your organization whom we should notify for information about the latest updates and releases for UID2.

>NOTE: Email contacts cannot log in to the UID2 Portal or modify the account. They only receive information notices. If an email contact wants to be removed, that action must be done by a team member. (**GWH_KT is this correct? Guessing.**)

## Configuring Email Contacts

In the UID2 Portal, on the Email Contacts page, you can perform all activities relating to configuring individuals who should be notified about UID2 updates, including the following:

- [Add an email contact](#add-an-email-contact)
- [Resend an invitation to an email contact](#resend-an-invitation-to-an-email-contact)
- [Edit information for an email contact](#edit-information-for-an-email-contact)
- [Remove an email contact](#remove-an-email-contact)

## Add an Email Contact

To add an email contact, complete the following steps:

1. Click **Add Email Contact**.
2. In the Add Email Contact window, provide the following information for the email contact:
   - Email Group Name: A text name for the emaail group. For example, `Engineering`.
   - Email Alias: An email address that is valid for the group. For example, `engineering@example.com`.
   - Contact Type: Choose from the drop-down list of contact types. For example, choose `Business` or `Technical`.
3. Click **Save Email Contact**. Your entry is added to the list. 

(**GWH_KT is there email verification in this case?**)

## Resend an Invitation to an Email Contact

If you added an email contact, you might need to resend the invitation. For example, perhaps the team member didn't receive the invitation or accidentally deleted it, or the invitation has expired.

To re-send the invitation for an email contact, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click **Resend Invitation**. The status updates to **Invitation Sent**.

**What needs to happen next?**

## Edit Information for an Email Contact

To edit information for an email contact, find the team member on the list and then, in the Actions column, click the Edit (pencil) icon. (**GWH_KT it doesn't work for me**)

## Remove an Email Contact

To remove an email contact, find the contact on the list and then, in the Actions column, click the delete (trashcan) icon. (**GWH_KT it doesn't work for me**)

(GWH_KT is the above accurate?)
