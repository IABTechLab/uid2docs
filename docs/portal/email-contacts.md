# Email Contacts

In the UID2 Portal, you can specify people from your organization whom we should notify for information about the latest updates and releases for UID2.

>NOTE: Email contacts cannot log in to the UID2 Portal or modify the account. They only receive information notices. If an email contact wants to be removed, that action must be done by a team member.
