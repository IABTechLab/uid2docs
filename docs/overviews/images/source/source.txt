From KR 1 May 2024:
Also, here is the figma file. It contains both UID2 and EUID workflows. They are on separate pages within the figma, keeping them together but separate at the same time. If you need help finding anything in the file please let me know! https://www.figma.com/file/43lE7yuZ2NWflmBdcJNBkw/UID2-Workflows?type=design&node-id=28%3A2&mode=design&t=ehOn5ACoXYTyK6aU-1
