Publishers can benefit from the cross-device presence of Unified ID 2.0 and take advantage of a consistent identity fabric on all of their inventory.

This page includes information about workflows, integration types, and documentation resources for publishers adopting UID2.

## Audience

This page is for the following UID2 participants:

- Publishers with web assets who want to use UID2 to generate identity tokens for the RTB bid stream, while integrating directly with UID2 rather than UID2-enabled single-sign-on or identity providers.
- Any organizations that propagate UID2 tokens to the bid stream via SSPs&#8212;for example, identity providers and SSO providers.
<!-- - Data clean rooms. -->

Publishers can choose to integrate with UID2 in a number of different ways:

- By integrating directly with UID2, either by using an SDK or via the UID2 API.
- By using an SSO provider.
- By working with an independent ID provider that manages the UID2 integration on behalf of the publisher.

## Benefits of UID2 for Publishers

Here are just some of the intended benefits of integrating with UID2:
- Addressable audience targeting on desktop, mobile, and CTV with a single identifier.
- Frequency management across devices.
- More relevant content recommendations.
- The ability to provide personalized ad experiences with relevant content.
- The ability to offer opt-out, with the goal of improving consumer privacy controls.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Request access to UID2 by filling out the form on the [Request Access](/request-access) page.
1. Identify the properties that you want to integrate with UID2.
1. Sign the UID2 contract.
1. Receive the UID2 authentication keys ([API keys](../getting-started/gs-api-keys.md)).
1. Build your integration to UID2 via an SDK or direct integration with the UID2 APIs, using the applicable documentation.

     NOTE: Be sure to encrypt request messages to UID2. For details, see [Encrypting Requests and Decrypting Responses](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md).
1. Test: 

    Work with SSPs to properly pass UID2s in bid requests.
    
    Confirm that UID2s are being generated and passed correctly in requests.
1. Go live.
