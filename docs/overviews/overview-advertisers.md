As an advertiser, you can upgrade your first-party data tactics with Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) to deliver omnichannel campaigns across devices with one identifier, for more durable identity strategies and better addressability.

Learn about benefits, workflow, documentation, and other resources for advertisers adopting UID2, as well as instructions for getting started.

## Benefits of UID2 for Advertisers

Here are just some of the intended benefits of using UID2 as part of your advertising strategy:
- Use a privacy-conscious form of CRM data in media-buying platforms.
- Simplify identity resolution at the household and individual level.
- Manage frequency and suppress audiences across channels and devices.
- Support identity use cases on Connected TV and on mobile apps where cookies don’t exist.
- Target and measure campaigns more holistically.
- Offer opt-out, with the goal of improving consumer privacy controls.

## Workflow for Advertisers

The following steps provide a high-level outline of the workflow intended for organizations that collect user data and push it to DSPs—for example, advertisers, identity graph providers, and third-party data providers.

The following process occurs in the background:
* The advertiser or data provider monitors <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-refresh-timestamp">refresh timestamps</Link> and updates UID2s when the current time exceeds the refresh timestamp for each stored UID2.

The following steps are an example of how an advertiser can integrate with UID2:

1. The advertiser sends a user’s <Link href="../ref-info/glossary-uid#gl-dii">directly identifying information (DII)</Link> to the UID2 Operator.
2. The UID2 Operator generates and returns a raw UID2 and refresh timestamp.
3. The advertiser stores the UID2 and refresh timestamp and sends the UID2-based first-party and third-party audience segments to the DSP. 

   Server-side: The advertiser stores the UID2 and refresh timestamp in a mapping table, DMP, data lake, or other server-side application.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Request access to UID2 by filling out the form on the [Request Access](/request-access) page.

   Someone will contact you to discuss your needs and advise on appropriate next steps.
1. Decide on your [participant](participants-overview.md#uid2-external-participants) role or roles.
1. Decide which implementation option you want to use.
1. Receive your credentials (see [UID2 Credentials](../getting-started/gs-credentials.md)) and follow the instructions in the implementation guide for the option you chose.

   :::note
   Be sure to encrypt request messages to UID2. For details, see [Encrypting Requests and Decrypting Responses](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md).
   :::
1. Test.
1. Go live.
