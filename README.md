## Introduction

Addressable advertising enables publishers and developers to provide the content and services consumers have come to enjoy, whether through mobile apps, streaming TV, or web experiences. This value exchange of the open internet has not always been well understood by, or communicated to, consumers. As the industry reduces reliance on the third-party cookie, we have an opportunity to move towards a new and better approach to identity for the open internet. This improved approach empowers content creators to have the value exchange conversations with consumers while giving them more control and transparency over their data. 

Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) is a deterministic identifier based on PII (e.g., email or phone number) with complete user transparency and privacy controls. The UID2 identifier ties logged-in experiences from publisher websites, mobile apps, and CTV apps. With several layers of security and privacy measures, UID2s safely distribute across the open internet. Initially built by The Trade Desk, responsibility for UID2 will transfer in mid-2021 to independent organizations for open-source code management, governance, administration, and system operations. UID2 is non-proprietary and accessible to constituents across the advertising ecosystem - including Advertisers, Publishers, DSPs, SSPs, SSOs, CDPs, CMPs, Identity Providers, Data Providers, and Measurement Providers - while they remain in compliance with a code of conduct.

UID2â€™s goal is to enable deterministic identity for advertising opportunities on the open internet with consumer transparency and controls. UID2 provides a collaborative framework for all constituents and a healthy, open internet by utilizing a transparent and interoperable approach.
