# DSP Direct Integration Instructions

This document provides instructions for DSPs who want to integrate with UID2 but who are using a programming language not supported by an existing UID2 SDK.

For a list of the existing SDKs, see [SDKs: Summary](../sdks/summary-sdks.md).

## Overview

DSPs must be able to decrypt UID2 tokens to raw UID2s and verify the token validity, so that they can use the decrypted tokens for targeted advertising and bidding purposes. To do this, a DSP must do the following:

- [Retrieve a set of encryption keys](#retrieverefresh-encryption-keys)
- [Decrypt UID2 tokens into raw UID2s](#decrypt-uid2-tokens-into-raw-uid2s)
- [Periodically re-retrieve the latest set of encryption keys](#retrieverefresh-encryption-keys)

An example implementation, in the [UID2 SDK for C#&nbsp;/&nbsp;.NET](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net), is the `BidstreamClient` class: see [BidstreamClient.cs](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/BidstreamClient.cs).

This document refers to additional code sections from the C#&nbsp;/&nbsp;.NET SDK as examples.

## Retrieve/Refresh Encryption Keys

To retrieve or refresh the encryption keys, so that you can decrypt UID2 tokens into raw UID2s, you'll need to write code to do the following:

- Encrypt the request.
- Call the endpoint.
- Decrypt the response.
- Parse the response.

You'll call the following API endpoint:

```
/v2/key/bidstream
```

Refresh the keys once at startup, and then periodically (recommended refresh interval is hourly).

The UID2 SDK for C# / .NET uses a `Refresh` function. For details, see [BidstreamClient.cs, line 26](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/BidstreamClient.cs#L26).

For an implementation example that shows encrypting the request and decrypting the response, see [Encryption and Decryption Code Examples](../getting-started/gs-encryption-decryption.md#encryption-and-decryption-code-examples).

The decrypted API response is in JSON format, and includes `site_data`, the list of domains or app names that are allowed for the site.

To see how all the fields are parsed, refer to the UID2 SDK for C#&nbsp;/&nbsp;.NET parse function: see [KeyParser.cs, lines 41-74](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/KeyParser.cs#L41-L74).

After decrypting the token into a raw UID2, if the token was generated on the client side, you must use the information in `site_data` to verify that a specific domain or app name is on the list of names allowed for it. For details, see [Verify the Domain or App Name](#for-tokens-generated-on-the-client-side-verify-the-domain-or-app-name).

## Decrypt UID2 Tokens into Raw UID2s

When you have current keys, you'll be able to decrypt a UID2 token into a raw UID2. You also need to check several conditions to make sure that the token is eligible for use in the bidstream.

You'll need to complete the following steps:

1. [Check the token version](#check-the-token-version).

1. [Decrypt the token](#decrypt-the-token).

1. [Make sure token lifetime and expiration values are valid](#make-sure-token-lifetime-and-expiration-are-valid).

1. [Verify that the domain or app name is valid](#for-tokens-generated-on-the-client-side-verify-the-domain-or-app-name).

The UID2 SDK for C# / .NET uses a `DecryptTokenIntoRawUid` function to perform these steps: see [BidstreamClient.cs, line 15](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/BidstreamClient.cs#L15).

### Check the Token Version

There are different UID2 token versions in current use, and later processing steps are a little different depending on whether the token version is v2 or a later version.

You can check the token version using the first few bytes of the token.

To review detailed logic, see [UID2Encryption.cs, lines 36-50](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L36-L50).

### Decrypt the Token

Use the master key and site key to decrypt the token. For a code example, refer to the `Decrypt` function: see [UID2Encryption.cs, line 29](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L29). This function decrypts UID2 tokens into raw UID2s as part of the UID2 SDK for C# / .NET, and includes logic to handle different token versions.

<!--
### For Tokens Generated on the Client Side: Honor Opt-Out Status

For tokens generated on the client side, there is an additional step with regard to opt-out. After decrypting the token, you must check for opt-out information indicating that the token does not contain a targetable UID2. If the user has opted out, you must not use the token for bidding.

For an example of how to do this check, review the code for the `DecryptV3` function: see [UID2Encryption.cs, line 201](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L201).

:::note
This step, which is only for tokens generated on the client side, is additional to checking the token against your opt-out records, which is required in all instances. For details, see [Honor User Opt-Out After Token Decryption](#honor-user-opt-out-after-token-decryption).

### Make Sure Token Lifetime and Expiration Are Valid

A token must be valid and current so that it can be used in the bidstream. You must do two things:

- Make sure that the token hasn't expired.
- Check that the token lifetime is a valid value.

For an example of code that makes sure the token hasn't expired, see [UID2Encryption.cs, line 196](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L196).

To make sure that the token lifetime has a valid value, check these two conditions:

- The lifetime of the token must not exceed the `max_bidstream_lifetime_seconds` value from the `/v2/key/bidstream` response.
- The time until token generation value must not exceed the `allow_clock_skew_seconds` value.

 For an example of how this is done, review the code for the `DoesTokenHaveValidLifetimeImpl` function: see [UID2Encryption.cs, line 237](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L237).

The following sections show how the lifetime for a token is calculated, and the time until token generation for versions later than v2. The calculation depends on the token version:

- [Calculating Token Lifetime: Token v2](#calculating-token-lifetime-token-v2)
- [Calculating Token Lifetime: All Later Versions](#calculating-token-lifetime-all-later-versions)

#### Calculating Token Lifetime: Token v2

For token v2, the calculation to make sure that the token lifetime is valid for bidstream use is as follows:

```
lifetime = token expiry - current time
```

For v2, we use the token expiry minus the current time to calculate the lifetime. This is because v2 doesn't have a **Token Generated** field, which is present in later versions. All token versions have an **Identity Established** field, but this indicates the time that the original token was generated, before any token refreshes, so it can't be used to calculate whether the token is still valid.

#### Calculating Token Lifetime: All Later Versions

For all token versions later than v2, the calculation to make sure that the token lifetime is valid for bidstream use is as follows:

```
lifetime = token expiry - token generated

time until token generation = token generated - current time
```

Versions later than v2 have a **Token Generated** field, which is updated if the token is refreshed, so we use this to calculate the token lifetime.

### For Tokens Generated on the Client Side: Verify the Domain or App Name

For tokens generated on the client side, after decrypting the token, you must verify that the domain name or app name is valid. To do this, make sure the `domainOrAppName` value is included in the `domain_names` list of the site ID, within the `site_data` section of the response from the `/v2/key/bidstream` API endpoint.

For an example of code that does this, refer to the `IsDomainOrAppNameAllowedForSite` function in [UID2Encryption.cs, line 245](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-client-net/blob/6ac53b106301e431a4aada3cbfbb93f8164ff7be/src/UID2.Client/UID2Encryption.cs#L245).

- [UID2 Client-Side Integration Guide for Prebid.js](integration-prebid-client-side.md)
- [UID2 Client-Side Integration Guide for Mobile](integration-mobile-client-side.md)

### Honor User Opt-Out After Token Decryption

After decrypting the token, you must check the resulting raw UID2 against your opt-out records. If it appears on your opt-out records, you must not use it for bidding. It's vital that you honor user opt-out preference.

For more information, refer to [Honor User Opt-Outs](dsp-guide.md#honor-user-opt-outs) in the *DSP Integration Guide*.

:::important
Honoring user opt-out is equally important in all scenarios. However, the steps are a little different depending on whether the token was generated on the client side or on the server side. Follow the applicable instructions so that all user opt-outs are honored.
