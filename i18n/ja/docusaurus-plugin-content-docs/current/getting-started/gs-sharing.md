# UID2 Sharing

In UID2, sharing is a process for distributing [raw UID2s](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-raw-uid2), either directly or encrypted into [UID2 tokens](../ref-info/glossary-uid.md#gl-raw-uid2), between UID2 participants.

All instances where a raw UID2 or UID2 token is shared with another participant fall under the definition of sharing. All sharing participants must meet the legal requirements specified in the following section, [Legal Requirements for UID2 Sharing](#legal-requirements-for-uid2-sharing).

In addition, all sharing participants who send raw UID2s must follow the security requirements specified in [Security Requirements for UID2 Sharing](../sharing/sharing-security). We encourage all participants who are sharing UID2 tokens to follow these steps.

Technical requirements vary according to your role and the implementation approach, and are covered in the instructions for each scenario in the sharing documentation. For a summary of scenarios, see [Approved Sharing Scenarios](sharing/sharing-overview.md#approved-sharing-scenarios) in the sharing overview.

## Legal Requirements for UID2 Sharing

:::important
UID2 sharing is allowed only for UID2 participants who have agreed to comply with the UID2 Participation Policy, with two exceptions described in the following section, [Exceptions](#exceptions).
:::

Before you can participate with UID2 sharing you must have in place an effective UID2 agreement that incorporates the UID2 Participation Policy. If you haven't satisfied this requirement, you cannot proceed with UID2 sharing.

If you've agreed to comply with the UID2 Participation Policy, you can proceed with UID2 sharing by following the documentation: see [UID2 Sharing](/docs/category/uid2-sharing).

If you still need to satisfy this requirement, or if you have any questions, please reach out to [UID2partners@thetradedesk.com](mailto:UID2partners@thetradedesk.com).

### Exceptions

The following specific types of UID2 participants who have not yet agreed to comply with the UID2 Participation Policy, but have an effective UID2 agreement in place, may until further notice continue with the following activities:

- Publishers: Share UID2 tokens in the bid stream.

- Advertisers and data providers: Share raw UID2s (outside of pixels) with authorized DSPs.
