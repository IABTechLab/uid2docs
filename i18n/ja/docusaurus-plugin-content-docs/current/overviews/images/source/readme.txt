Note to translator 2 May 2024 GWH

These SVG files are out of date. Needs updates to the SVG files.
And then, the Japanese MD files can be updated to reference the SVG files rather than JPG files as we now have.
Please move the SVG files to the /images/ folder then, and we won't need this resource folder anymore.

Thank you.
