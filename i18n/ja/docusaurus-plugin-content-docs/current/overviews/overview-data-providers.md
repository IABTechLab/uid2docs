Data and measurement providers can reduce identity fragmentation by adopting Unified ID 2.0 to connect data with a more durable, omnichannel and cross-device identifier to fulfill their customer use cases.

The following sections break down the workflows, integration types and documentation for data providers adopting UID2.

## Audience

This page is for partners offering data or related services for online or offline advertising, such as providers of the following:
- Data onboarding
- Third-party audiences

## Benefits of UID2 for Data Providers

Here are just some of the intended benefits for data providers using UID2:
- Upgrade to a more privacy-conscious identifier which offers opt-out for consumer privacy control.
- Facilitate the use of a connective identity thread between platforms and channels for resolution, activation, and measurement.
- Aim to future-proof audience segments with deterministic IDs for advertisers.
- Connect online and offline data with a common ID to aim for more precision.
- More accurately measure campaigns with or without third-party cookies.
