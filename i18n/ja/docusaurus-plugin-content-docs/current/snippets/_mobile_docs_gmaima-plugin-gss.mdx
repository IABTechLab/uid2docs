If you intend to generate UID2 tokens to send to the [Google GMA SDK](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk) or the [Google IMA SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/), assuming you have followed the instructions in this guide, you must also add the UID2 GMA/IMA plugins into your mobile app. For instructions, refer to the applicable plug-in guide:

- [UID2 GMA Plugin for Android Integration Guide](../guides/mobile-plugin-gma-android.md)
- [UID2 GMA Plugin for iOS Integration Guide](../guides/mobile-plugin-gma-ios.md)
- [UID2 IMA Plugin for Android Integration Guide](../guides/mobile-plugin-ima-android.md)
- [UID2 IMA Plugin for iOS Integration Guide](../guides/mobile-plugin-ima-ios.md)

You do not need to explicitly make the `getAdvertisingToken()` method call to retrieve the advertising tokens and pass them into Google GMA/IMA SDK manually. The UID2 GMA/IMA plugins manage this for you.

All you need to do is make sure that `getAdvertisingToken()` returns a non-null string object:

<Tabs groupId="language-selection">
<TabItem value='android' label='Android'>

```js
UID2Manager.getInstance().getAdvertisingToken()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ios' label='iOS'>

```js
UID2Manager.shared.getAdvertisingToken()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the token exists, the Google GMA/IMA plug-ins can retrieve it automatically via the UID2 GMA/IMA plugins.
