[UID2 Overview](../README.md) > Opt-Out Workflow

# Opt-Out Workflow Overview

The following steps provide a high-level outline of the workflow intended for users who engage with publishers or their identity providers. 

1. Users visit the [Transparency and Control Portal](https://transparentadvertising.org), where they can globally opt out of UID2.
2. Opt-out requests are sent to the UID2 Administrator.
3. UID2 distributes the opt-out information to DSPs.
4. UID2 distributes the opt-out information in the responses from all respective API endpoints.

This workflow allows users to consent to the creation of UID2 identifiers and manage their UID2 consent and privacy settings through the Transparency and Control Portal.
