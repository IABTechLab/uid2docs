# Opt-Out Workflow Overview

![User Trust Workflow](/images/user_trust_workflow.jpg)

This workflow is for users engaging with publishers or publisher-related SSOs and identity providers. This workflow allows a user to consent to the creation of a UID2 and manage their UID2 consent and privacy settings in the Opt-Out Portal.


1. Users visit the Opt-Out Portal where they can globally opt-out of UID2 for all publishers.
2. Opt-out requests are sent to UID2 Administrator.
3. UID2 Administrators distribute the request to DSPs.
4. UID2 Operators distribute the request to publishers utilizing the refresh token.
